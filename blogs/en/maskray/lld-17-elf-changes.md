# lld 17 ELF changes

LLVM 17 will be released. As usual, I maintain lld/ELF and have added some notes to [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/17.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/17.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst). Here I will elaborate on some changes.

- When `--threads=` is not specified, the number of concurrency is now capped to 16. A large `--thread=` can harm performance, especially with some system malloc implementations like glibc's. ([D147493](https://reviews.llvm.org/D147493))
- `--remap-inputs=` and `--remap-inputs-file=` are added to remap input files. ([D148859](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148859))
- `--lto=` is now available to support `clang -funified-lto` ([D123805](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123805))
- `--lto-CGO[0-3]` is now available to control `CodeGenOpt::Level` independent of the LTO optimization level. ([D141970](https://reviews.llvm.org/D141970))
- `--check-dynamic-relocations=` is now correct 32-bit targets when the addend is larger than 0x80000000. ([D149347](https://reviews.llvm.org/D149347))
- `--print-memory-usage` has been implemented for memory regions. ([D150644](https://reviews.llvm.org/D150644))
- `SHF_MERGE`, `--icf=`, and `--build-id=fast` have switched to 64-bit xxh3. ([D154813](https://reviews.llvm.org/D154813))
- Quoted output section names can now be used in linker scripts. (`#60496 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60496>`_)
- `MEMORY` can now be used without a `SECTIONS` command. ([D145132](https://reviews.llvm.org/D145132))
- `REVERSE` can now be used in input section descriptions to reverse the order of input sections. ([D145381](https://reviews.llvm.org/D145381))
- Program header assignment can now be used within `OVERLAY`. This functionality was accidentally lost in 2020. ([D150445](https://reviews.llvm.org/D150445))
- Operators `^` and `^=` can now be used in linker scripts.
- LoongArch is now supported.
- `DT_AARCH64_MEMTAG_*` dynamic tags are now supported. ([D143769](https://reviews.llvm.org/D143769))
- AArch32 port now supports BE-8 and BE-32 modes for big-endian. ([D140201](https://reviews.llvm.org/D140201)) ([D140202](https://reviews.llvm.org/D140202)) ([D150870](https://reviews.llvm.org/D150870))
- `R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G*` relocations are now supported. ([D153407](https://reviews.llvm.org/D153407))
- `.ARM.exidx` sections may start at non-zero output section offset. ([D148033](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148033))
- Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions is now implemented. ([D139092](https://reviews.llvm.org/D139092))
- BTI landing pads are now added to PLT entries accessed by range extension thunks or relative vtables. ([D148704](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148704)) ([D153264](https://reviews.llvm.org/D153264))
- AArch64 short range thunk has been implemented to mitigate the performance loss of a long range thunk. ([D148701](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148701))
- `R_AVR_8_LO8/R_AVR_8_HI8/R_AVR_8_HLO8/R_AVR_LO8_LDI_GS/R_AVR_HI8_LDI_GS` have been implemented. ([D147100](https://reviews.llvm.org/D147100)) ([D147364](https://reviews.llvm.org/D147364))
- `--no-power10-stubs` now works for PowerPC64.
- `DT_PPC64_OPT` is now supported. ([D150631](https://reviews.llvm.org/D150631))
- `PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES` is added to include the SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES section. ([D152065](https://reviews.llvm.org/D152065))
- `R_RISCV_PLT32` is added to support C++ relative vtables. ([D143115](https://reviews.llvm.org/D143115))
- RISC-V global pointer relaxation has been implemented. Specify `--relax-gp` to enable the linker relaxation. ([D143673](https://reviews.llvm.org/D143673))
- The symbol value of `foo` is correctly handled when `--wrap=foo` and RISC-V linker relaxation are used. ([D151768](https://reviews.llvm.org/D151768))
- x86-64 large data sections are now placed away from code sections to alleviate relocation overflow pressure. ([D150510](https://reviews.llvm.org/D150510))

When using glibc malloc with a larger `std::thread::hardware_concurrency` (say, more than 16), parallel relocation scanning can be quite slower without the `--threads=16` throttling.

I usually try to make extensions, unless too LLVM internal specific (e.g. `--lto-*`), accepted by the binutils community. The [feature request](https://sourceware.org/PR30374) for `--remap-inputs=` and `--remap-inputs-file=` was a success story, implemented by GNU ld 2.41.

`PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES` output is still not quite right. I also question about its usefulness. Unfortunately, at this stage, it's difficult to [get rid of it](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/pull/386).

This cycle has a surprising number of new features, and I have spent lots of spare time reviewing them to ensure that they are robust and properly tested. Most stuff is completely unrelated to my day job.

There are quite a few AArch32 changes from Arm engineers, primarily about big-endian support and Cortex-M Security Extensions.

I was firm that the RISC-V global pointer relaxation needs to be opt-in. I had a GNU ld `--relax-gp` patch last year and utilitized this opportunity (ld.lld feature proposal) to move forward GNU ld `--relax-gp`. It's unfortunately opt-out, but having an option is a step forward.

This release adds support for LoongArch, which is a relatively new architecture that took inspiration from Mips and RISC-V.

## Speed

Unlike previous versions, there is just a minor performance improvement compared with lld 15.0.0. I added a simplified version of 64-bit xxh3 into the `LLVMSupport` library and [utilized it in lld](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/63750).

This influence to the total link time is small. However, if I test the time proportion of the hash function in the total link time, I can see that the proportion has been reduced to nearly one third. On some workload and some machines this effect may be larger.
