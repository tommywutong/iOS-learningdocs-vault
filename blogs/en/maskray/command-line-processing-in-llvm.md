# Command line processing in LLVM

[中文版](https://maskray.me/blog/zh/2020-10-03-llvm-command-line-processing)

Updated in 2023-05.

There are two libraries for processing command line options in LLVM.

## `llvm/Support/ComandLine.h`

See [https://llvm.org/docs/CommandLine.html](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandLine.html) for documentation.

Global variables (mostly `llvm::cl::opt<type>`, some `llvm::cl::list<type>`) are most common to represent command-line options. The `llvm::cl::opt` constructor registers this command line option in a global registry. The program calls `llvm::cl::ParseCommandLineOptions(argc, argv, ...)` in `main` to parse the command line options. `opt` supports various integer types, `bool`, `std::string`, etc. Defining some specialization can support support custom class/enum types.

```cpp
static cl::OptionCategory cat("split-file Options");

static cl::opt<std::string> input(cl::Positional, cl::desc("filename"),
                                  cl::cat(cat));

static cl::opt<std::string> output(cl::Positional, cl::desc("directory"),
                                   cl::value_desc("directory"), cl::cat(cat));

static cl::opt<bool> noLeadingLines("no-leading-lines",
                                    cl::desc("Don't preserve line numbers"),
                                    cl::cat(cat));

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
  cl::ParseCommandLineOptions(argc, argv, ...);
}
```

Beside functionality options, there are many internal command line options in LLVM.

- Having an option to select different code paths. Usually introduced when one feature is under development and is considered experimental.
- The functionality has been stable for a period of time, and the default value has been changed to true. In some cases, users who find a regression can set the option to false as a workaround.
- Provide more input to a pass for testing.

The `llvm::cl` library is easy to use. Adding a new option only requires adding a variable to a source file. The library provides some icing on the cake, e.g. recommending options with similar spellings in case of an incorrect spelling. But the customizability is poor. For example:

- A `llvm::cl::opt<bool>` option accepts various input methods such as `-v 0 -v=0 -v false -v=false -v=False`
- It is inconvenient to support both `--long` and `--no-long` at the same time. Occasionally, the workaround is to set a variable for `--no-long`. If you want to deal with two options override each other, you must determine the relative position of the two options in the command line

User-oriented external tools often have such customization requirements. The style of GNU `getopt_long` is `--long`. `-long` and `--long` can be mixed in `llvm/Support/ComandLine.h`, and mandatory `--` is not supported for a long time.

LLVM binary utilities (llvm-nm, llvm-objdump, llvm-readelf, etc.) in order to replace GNU binutils, Need to provide grouped short options in the style of POSIX shell utilities (`-ab` means `-a -b`). This feature is not supported for a long time, which troubles users who want to migrate to LLVM binary utilities.

In addition, `llvm::cl::opt` is a singleton, and local variables can also be defined to dynamically increase options, but this usage is rare (llvm-readobj and llvm-cov). There is also a very peculiar usage. The legacy pass manager in the opt tool automatically obtains the pass name list and registers a large number of global options.

To prevent errors, `llvm::cl::opt` does not support defining the same option multiple times. If you link both shared object and archive LLVM libraries at the same time, a classic error will be triggered:

```plaintext
: CommandLine Error: Option 'help-list' registered more than once!
LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options
```

If you want to set the value of the `llvm::cl::opt` variable in Clang, you can use `-mllvm -option=value`. Use ld.lld/LLVMgold.so Full/Thin LTO to set these option values, use `-plugin-opt=-option=value` (ld.lld can also use `-mllvm`).

## `llvm/Option/OptTable.h`

This was originally developed for Clang. It was later moved to llvm and adopted by many components such as llvm-objcopy, lld, and most binutils counterparts (llvm-symbolizer, llvm-objdump, etc). OptTable uses a domain-specific language (TableGen) to describe command line options and generate a parser. The parsed options are organized into an object, and each option is represented by an integer. It is easy to check whether a pair of boolean options with variable default values (`--demangle --no-demangle`) are in effect: `Args.hasFlag(OPT_demangle, OPT_no_demangle, !IsAddr2Line)`.

Here is an example TableGen file:

```plaintext
multiclass B<string name, string help1, string help2> {
  def NAME: Flag<["--", "-"], name>, HelpText<help1>;
  def no_ # NAME: Flag<["--", "-"], "no-" # name>, HelpText<help2>;
}

multiclass Eq<string name, string help> {
  def NAME #_EQ: Joined<["--", "-"], name #"=">,
                  HelpText<help>;
  def: Separate<["--", "-"], name>, Alias<!cast<Joined>(NAME #_EQ)>;
}

defm debug_file_directory: Eq<"debug-file-directory", "Path to directory where to look for debug files">, MetaVarName<"<dir>">;
defm default_arch: Eq<"default-arch", "Default architecture (for multi-arch objects)">;
defm demangle: B<"demangle", "Demangle function names", "Don't demangle function names">;
def functions: F<"functions", "Print function name for a given address">;
```

In the C++ source file, one writes:

```cpp
opt::InputArgList Args = parseOptions(argc, argv, IsAddr2Line, Saver, Tbl);

LLVMSymbolizer::Options Opts;
...
Opts.DebugFileDirectory = Args.getAllArgValues(OPT_debug_file_directory_EQ);
Opts.DefaultArch = Args.getLastArgValue(OPT_default_arch_EQ).str();
Opts.Demangle = Args.hasFlag(OPT_demangle, OPT_no_demangle, !IsAddr2Line);
Opts.DWPName = Args.getLastArgValue(OPT_dwp_EQ).str();
```

### Grouped short options

Note that GCC's command line options do not support grouped short options, so Clang does not implement it. Some binutils counterparts need the support, and I added grouped short options (D83639) in July 2020.

Anecdote: LLD uses this library to parse command-line options. GNU ld actually supports grouped short options, for example, `ld.bfd -vvv` means `-v -v -v`. I suggested that GNU ld actually supports many `-long` style options, and supporting grouped short options can cause confusion.

```plaintext
% touch an ommand':)'
% ld.bfd -you -can -ofcourse -use -this -Long -command -Line':)'
:)
```

binutils 2.36 is expected to deprecate grouped short options :)

### Target-specific options

In Clang, `clang/include/clang/Driver/Options.td` declares both generic and target-specific options.

On the plus side, if a useful feature is machine-specific in GCC, it is easy to implement it as a target-agnostic option in Clang.

On the down side, if it is an inherently target-specific option, it is easy to forget to report an error for other targets. There will usually be a `-Wunused-command-line-argument` warning, but a warning may not be good enough.

For example, GCC's powerpc port doesn't support `-march=`, but Clang incorrectly parsed and ignored it, resulting in a `-Wunused-command-line-argument` warning. [https://reviews.llvm.org/D145141](https://reviews.llvm.org/D145141) changed the warning to an error.

To prevent the aforementioned issues, when dealing with target-specific options in `clang/include/clang/Driver/Options.td`, we should add the ability to annotate compatible `clang::driver::ToolChain`.

### Comparison with `getopt_long`

Many users of `getopt_long` use a switch and a large number of cases to process command line options, and it is easy to create various position dependent behaviors. For large build systems, sometimes it is not clear where the compiler/linker options are added, and some position dependent behaviors are quite annoying.

The `Args.getLastArgValue(..., ...)` pattern widely used in Clang has a limitation. For options that take a value, we typically verify just the last option, ignoring previous options. For example, invalid option values non-last options in `clang -ftls-model=xxx -ftls-model=initial-exec` and `clang -mstack-protector-guard=xxx -mstack-protector-guard=global` cannot be detected.
