# lld 14 ELF changes

llvm-project 14 will be released soon. I added some lld/ELF notes to [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/14.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/14.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst). Here I will elaborate on some changes.

- `--export-dynamic-symbol-list` has been added. ([D107317](https://reviews.llvm.org/D107317)) When I added `--export-dynamic-symbol` to GNU ld, H.J. Lu asked me to add this option. I asked myself whether this was necessary but then realized this may help deprecate `--dynamic-list` in the long term. [`--dynamic-list`](https://maskray.me/blog/2020-11-15-explain-gnu-linker-options#bsymbolic-and---dynamic-list) is confusing. It has a different semantics for executables and shared objects. The symbolic intention for shared objects isn't clear.
- `--why-extract` has been added to query why archive members/lazy object files are extracted. ([D109572](https://reviews.llvm.org/D109572)) This was a long missing feature from ld.lld `-Map`. I picked a separate option because I realized that this need is often orthogonal to input section to output section map.
- If `-Map` is specified, `--cref` will be printed to the specified file. ([D114663](https://reviews.llvm.org/D114663)) A linker's stdout output is often interleaved with different information, so being able to redirect a piece of information to a file is useful. I think it would be nice if GNU ld had `--cref=<file>` and not reused `-Map`.
- `-z bti-report` and `-z cet-report` are now supported. ([D113901](https://reviews.llvm.org/D113901))
- `--lto-pgo-warn-mismatch` has been added. ([D104431](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104431))
- Archives without an index (symbol table) are now supported and work with `--warn-backrefs`. One may build such an archive with `llvm-ar rcS [--thin]` to save space. ([D117284](https://reviews.llvm.org/D117284)) In 15.0.0, the archive symbol table will be [entirely ignored](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119074). [Archives and --start-lib](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-01-16-archives-and-start-lib) has more context.
- No longer deduplicate local symbol names at the default optimization level of `-O1`. This results in a larger `.strtab` (usually less than 1%) but a faster link time. Use optimization level `-O2` to restore the deduplication. In 15.0.0, the `-O2` deduplication is dropped to help parallel `.symtab` write.
- In relocatable output, relocations to discarded symbols now use tombstone values. ([D116946](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116946))
- `--compress-debug-sections=zlib` is now run in parallel. `{clang,gcc} -gz` link actions are significantly faster. ([D117853](https://reviews.llvm.org/D117853)) [Compressed debug sections#linkers](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-01-23-compressed-debug-sections#linkers) has more context.
- "relocation out of range" diagnostics and a few uncommon diagnostics now report an object file location beside a source file location. ([D112518](https://reviews.llvm.org/D112518))
- The write of `.rela.dyn` and `SHF_MERGE|SHF_STRINGS` sections (e.g. `.debug_str`) is now run in parallel.

Linker script changes:

- Orphan section placement now picks a more suitable segment. Previously the algorithm might pick a read-only segment for a writable orphan section and make the segment writable. ([D111717](https://reviews.llvm.org/D111717))
- An empty output section moved by an `INSERT` comment now gets appropriate flags. ([D118529](https://reviews.llvm.org/D118529))
- Negation in a memory region attribute is now correctly handled. ([D113771](https://reviews.llvm.org/D113771))

Architecture specific changes:

- The AArch64 port now supports adrp+ldr and adrp+add optimizations. `--no-relax` can suppress the optimization. This is a time that ld.lld gets an optimization (for the linked output) earlier than GNU ld. ([D112063](https://reviews.llvm.org/D112063)) ([D117614](https://reviews.llvm.org/D117614))
- The x86-32 port now supports TLSDESC (`-mtls-dialect=gnu2`). ([D112582](https://reviews.llvm.org/D112582))
- The x86-64 port now handles non-RAX/non-adjacent `R_X86_64_GOTPC32_TLSDESC` and `R_X86_64_TLSDESC_CALL` (`-mtls-dialect=gnu2`). ([D114416](https://reviews.llvm.org/D114416))
- The x86-32 and x86-64 ports now support mixed TLSDESC and TLS GD, i.e. mixing objects compiled with and without `-mtls-dialect=gnu2` referencing the same TLS variable is now supported. ([D114416](https://reviews.llvm.org/D114416))
- For x86-64, `--no-relax` now suppresses `R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX` and `R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX` GOT optimization ([D113615](https://reviews.llvm.org/D113615))
- `R_X86_64_PLTOFF64` is now supported. ([D112386](https://reviews.llvm.org/D112386))
- `R_AARCH64_NONE`, `R_PPC_NONE`, and `R_PPC64_NONE` in input REL relocation sections are now supported.

Breaking changes

- `e_entry` no longer falls back to the address of `.text` if the entry symbol does not exist. Instead, a value of 0 will be written. ([D110014](https://reviews.llvm.org/D110014))
- `--lto-pseudo-probe-for-profiling` has been removed. In LTO, the compiler enables this feature automatically. ([D110209](https://reviews.llvm.org/D110209))
- Use of `--[no-]define-common`, `-d`, `-dc`, and `-dp` will now get a warning. They will be removed or ignored in 15.0.0. (`llvm-project#53660 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53660>`_)

## Speed

(Compared with glibc malloc, linking against libmimalloc.a is 1.12x as fast.) I use a `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=$HOME/Dev/mimalloc/out/release/libmimalloc.a -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='clang;lld' -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86` `-fno-pic -no-pie` build. The host compiler is a close-to-main clang. Both input and output is in tmpfs.

I have made dozens of changes scattering across the lld/ELF codebase to improve performance, e.g.

## Memory usage

I have made some changes decreasing `sizeof(SymbolUnion)` and `sizeof(InputSection)`. There is a 1~2% decrease for some programs with several malloc implementations.

ThinLTO application will see more reduction. lld uses file-backed mmap to read input files. For ThinLTO indexing, the page buffers are nearly unused after symbol resolution. I have changed lld to call `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` to overlap the page buffer memory with the memory allocated by LTO library (mostly ThinLTO import and export lists): [https://reviews.llvm.org/D116367](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116367). This change led to a 16% reduction when linking a large executable.

I have made another change that changed the `-–start-lib` code path to cache the symbol interning result, which led to 0.6% reduction: [https://reviews.llvm.org/D116390](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116390).

## Executable size

I have audited commits by others. Almost all have nearly no size difference or slightly increase code size. I have made some patches which improve flexibility and increase code size, but a dozen which decreases the code size. In a `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++` builds,

```sh
% stat -c %s llvm-13/out/release/lib/../tools/lld/ELF/CMakeFiles/lldELF.dir/**/*.o | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s}'
6490096
% stat -c %s llvm-14/out/release/lib/../tools/lld/ELF/CMakeFiles/lldELF.dir/**/*.o | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s}'
5177744
```

## Thoughts

mold 1.1 was just released. People who wonder about lld's performance can check out [Why isn't ld.lld faster?](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-12-19-why-isnt-ld.lld-faster).

If one module consists of N features, the time complexity incrementally updating this module may be more than O(N), because the N features may interact and result in more than linear edges (though possibly still smaller than O(N^2)). This rule applies to introducing multi-threading to ld.lld's symbol processing.
