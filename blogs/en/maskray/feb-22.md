# Bit-field layout

The C and C++ standards leave nearly every detail to the implementation. C23 §6.7.3.2:

> An implementation may allocate any addressable storage unit large enough to hold a bit-field. If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows another bit-field in a structure shall be packed into adjacent bits of the same unit. If insufficient space remains, whether a bit-field that does not fit is put into the next unit or overlaps adjacent units is implementation-defined. The order of allocation of bit-fields within a unit (high-order to low-order or low-order to high-order) is implementation-defined. The alignment of the addressable storage unit is unspecified

C++ is also terse — `[class.bit]p1`:

> Allocation of bit-fields within a class object is implementation-defined. Alignment of bit-fields is implementation-defined. Bit-fields are packed into some addressable allocation unit.

The actual rules come from the platform ABI:

- — used on Linux, macOS, BSD, and most non-Windows platforms. The Itanium C++ ABI (

  section 2.4

  ) defers bit-field placement to "the base C ABI" but adds its own constraints (notably: bit-fields are never placed in the tail padding of a base class).
- AArch64 AAPCS

  has a more detailed description.
- — used on Windows (MSVC). In GCC and Clang, structs with the

  attribute also mimics this ABI.

Clang implements both ABIs in `clang/lib/AST/RecordLayoutBuilder.cpp`. It processes bit-fields in **two distinct phases**:

1. (storage units) — assign a bit offset to every bit-field. This is ABI-specified and determines

  and

  .
2. (access units) — choose what LLVM IR loads and stores to emit. This is a compiler optimization that affects generated code but not the ABI.

Understanding these separately is the key to understanding bit-fields. This article focuses on Itanium (the default on most platforms), with a section on how the Microsoft ABI differs.

## Phase 1: Storage Units

In `clang/lib/AST/RecordLayoutBuilder.cpp`, `ItaniumRecordLayoutBuilder::LayoutFields` lays out fields of a `RecordDecl`. For each bit field, it calls `LayoutBitField` to determine the storage unit and bit offset.

A **storage unit** is a region of `sizeof(T)` bytes, by default aligned to `alignof(T)`. For an `int` bit-field, that's a 4-byte region at a 4-byte-aligned offset. The alignment can be reduced by the `packed` attribute and `#pragma pack`.

- — the unit's size in bits
- in bits — the unit's alignment (before modifiers)
- — the first bit after the last bit-field

### Itanium's Core Rule

```cpp
if (FieldSize == 0 ||
    (AllowPadding &&
     (FieldOffset & (FieldAlign-1)) + FieldSize > StorageUnitSize))
  FieldOffset = alignTo(FieldOffset, FieldAlign);
```

Compute where `FieldOffset` falls within its aligned storage unit. If the remaining space is less than `FieldSize`, round up to the next aligned boundary. Otherwise, pack the bit-field at the current position.

### Declared Type Matters

Consider two structs that store the same total number of bits (7 + 7 + 2 = 16) but use different declared types:

```c
struct U8  { uint8_t  a:7, b:7, c:2; };   // sizeof = 3
struct U16 { uint16_t a:7, b:7, c:2; };   // sizeof = 2

struct S1 { int a:14; int b:10; int c:30; };   // sizeof = 8
```

**Walk-through for `U8`** (all fields have StorageUnitSize = 8, FieldAlign = 8):

- at bit 0. Position = 0, 0 + 7 = 7 \<= 8. Fits.
- at bit 7. Position = 7, 7 + 7 = 14 \> 8. Doesn't fit. New unit at bit 8.
- at bit 15. Position = 15 - 8 = 7, 7 + 2 = 9 \> 8. Doesn't fit. New unit at bit 16.

Three 1-byte storage units. `sizeof(U8) = 3`. Eight padding bits wasted.

**Walk-through for `U16`** (all fields have StorageUnitSize = 16, FieldAlign = 16):

- at bit 0. Position = 0, 0 + 7 = 7 \<= 16. Fits.
- at bit 7. Position = 7, 7 + 7 = 14 \<= 16. Fits.
- at bit 14. Position = 14, 14 + 2 = 16 \<= 16. Fits.

One 2-byte storage unit. `sizeof(U16) = 2`. No waste.

**Walk-through for `S1`** (all fields have StorageUnitSize = 32, FieldAlign = 32):

- at bit 0. Position = 0, 14 fits in 32.
- at bit 14. Position = 14, 14 + 10 = 24 \<= 32. Fits.

  Bits 24–31 are padding (unfilled tail of the first storage unit).
- at bit 24. Position = 24, 24 + 30 = 54 \> 32. Doesn't fit. New unit at bit 32.

  Bits 62–63 are padding (unfilled tail of the second storage unit).

`sizeof(S1) = 8`, `alignof(S1) = 4`.

Note: Phase 1 uses two `int` storage units, but Phase 2 is free to merge `a`, `b`, and `c` into a single `i64` access unit (since there are no non-bit-field barriers and 8 bytes fits in a register). On x86_64, the LLVM type ends up as `{ i64 }`.

### Mixed Types

When bit-fields have different declared types, the storage unit size changes:

```c
struct S2 { int a:24; short b:8; };   // sizeof = 4
```

- is

  (StorageUnitSize = 32). Placed at bit 0.
- is

  (StorageUnitSize = 16, FieldAlign = 16). Current offset = 24. Position within a 16-bit aligned unit: 24 % 16 = 8. 8 + 8 = 16 \<= 16. Fits.

`sizeof(S2) = 4`. The `short` bit-field overlaps into the `int`'s storage unit. Under Itanium, storage units of different types _can_ share bytes.

The `short` can also reuse space left by a smaller bit-field:

```c
struct S2b { int a:16; short b:8; };   // sizeof = 4
```

- is

  (StorageUnitSize = 32). Placed at bit 0.
- is

  (StorageUnitSize = 16, FieldAlign = 16). Current offset = 16. Position within a 16-bit aligned unit: 16 % 16 = 0. 0 + 8 = 8 \<= 16. Fits.

Here `b`'s 16-bit storage unit (bits 16–31) falls entirely within `a`'s 32-bit storage unit.

> Under Microsoft ABI, `sizeof` is 8: the type size change from `int` to `short` forces a new storage unit.

This overlapping extends to non-bit-field members too. A non-bit-field can be allocated within the unfilled bytes of a preceding bit-field's storage unit:

```c
struct S2c { uint16_t first:8; uint8_t second; };   // sizeof = 2
```

- is

  . Placed at bit 0. Uses 8 bits of a 16-bit storage unit (bytes 0–1).
- is a non-bit-field

  . The bit-field state resets, but DataSize is only 1 byte.

  (alignment 1) goes at

  (bit 8) — inside

  's storage unit.

Note that this overlapping means a write to `first` via its access unit could touch byte 1 where `second` lives. Phase 2 must ensure the access units don't clobber each other (see [Hard constraints](#itanium-merging-algorithm)).

> Under Microsoft ABI, `sizeof` is 4: `first` gets a full `uint16_t` unit (2 bytes), and `second` starts at byte 2 instead of byte 1.

### Non-bit-field After Bit-field

When a non-bit-field field cannot fit within the remaining bytes, it resets the bit-field state and unfilled bits become padding:

```c
struct S3 { int a:10; int b:6; char c; int d:6; };   // sizeof = 4
```

- at bit 0,

  at bit 10 — both fit in the first

  storage unit.

  occupy 16 bits = 2 bytes, leaving 16 bits unused in the 32-bit storage unit.
- is not a bit-field. It resets

  to 0.

  (a

  , alignment 1) goes at

  (bit 16). A subsequent bit-field could have used bits 16–31, but the non-bit-field

  claims byte 2.
- is a new

  bit-field. Current bit offset = 24 (byte 3). Position = 24 % 32 = 24. 24 + 6 = 30 \<= 32. Fits.

`sizeof(S3) = 4`.

> Under Microsoft ABI, `sizeof` is 12: `a`+`b` get a full `int` unit (4 bytes), `c` starts at byte 4, and `d` gets a new `int` unit at byte 8.

### Bit-field After Non-bit-field

The overlap works in the other direction too. When a bit-field follows a non-bit-field, its storage unit can encompass the preceding bytes:

```c
struct NB { char a; int b:4; };   // sizeof = 4
```

- is a

  at byte 0. DataSize = 1 byte.
- is

  . FieldOffset = 8, FieldAlign = 32, StorageUnitSize = 32. Position:

  .

  . Fits.

`b`'s 4-byte `int` storage unit (bytes 0–3) encompasses `a` at byte 0. No padding is inserted — the core rule only cares whether the field fits within an aligned unit, not whether that unit overlaps earlier non-bit-field storage.

> Under Microsoft ABI, `sizeof` is 8: `b`'s `int` unit starts at byte 4, after `a` is padded to `int` alignment.

### Attributes and Pragmas

Several attributes and pragmas alter the placement rules. They all work by changing `FieldAlign`.

**`packed`** — sets `FieldAlign = 1` (bit-granular packing). Bitfields pack at the next available _bit_ with no alignment constraint.

```c
struct [[gnu::packed]] P { int x:4, y:30, z:30; };
// 4 + 30 + 30 = 64 bits = 8 bytes. sizeof = 8.
```

> Under Microsoft ABI, `sizeof` is 12: each bit-field must fit within a single `int` unit, so `x`, `y`, and `z` each get their own 4-byte unit.

`packed` can also be applied to individual fields:

```c
struct P2 { short a:8; [[gnu::packed]] int b:30; };   // sizeof = 6, b at bit 8
// Without packed on b: b at bit 32, sizeof = 8
```

Without packed, `b`'s FieldAlign is 32, so it doesn't fit in `a`'s `short` storage unit and starts a new `int` unit at bit 32. With packed, `b`'s FieldAlign drops to 1, so it packs immediately after `a` at bit 8.

**`#pragma pack(N)`** — caps `FieldAlign` at `N * 8` bits and suppresses the padding-insertion test (`AllowPadding = false`, so the overflow check is skipped — the field is placed at the current offset without rounding up).

```c
#pragma pack(1)
struct PP { char a; int b:4; int c:28; char s; };   // sizeof = 6
#pragma pack()
```

`b` packs at bit 8 by the normal core rule — `(8 & 31) + 4 = 12 ≤ 32`, so it fits. Without `#pragma pack`, `c:28` at bit 12 would fail the same check — `12 + 28 = 40 > 32` — and round up to bit 32. With `#pragma pack(1)`, `AllowPadding` is false, so the overflow check is skipped and `c` stays at bit 12. Total: `a`(8) + `b`+`c`(32) + `s`(8) = 48 bits = 6 bytes.

**`aligned(N)`** — forces minimum alignment. Overrides `packed`, but is itself overridden by `#pragma pack`.

```c
struct A { char a; [[gnu::aligned(16)]] int b:1; char c; };
// b aligned to 16 bytes = bit 128. c at byte 17. sizeof = 32, alignof = 16.
```

**Precedence** (for non-zero-width bit-fields): `#pragma pack` \> `aligned` attr \> `packed` attr \> natural alignment.

### Zero-width Bitfields

`T : 0` rounds up to `alignof(T)`, acting as a separator. Subsequent fields start in a new storage unit.

```c
struct Z { char x; int : 0; char y; };
// x86:         y at offset 4, sizeof = 5, alignof = 1
// ARM/AArch64: y at offset 4, sizeof = 8, alignof = 4
```

On most targets, anonymous bit-fields don't contribute to struct alignment. But on AArch32/AArch64 (with `useZeroLengthBitfieldAlignment()`), zero-width bit-fields _do_ raise the struct's alignment.

Zero-width bit-fields are exempt from both `packed` and `#pragma pack` — they always round up to `alignof(T)`.

### Microsoft ABI Differences

Clang uses the Microsoft layout rules in two situations: targeting a Windows triple (e.g. `x86_64-windows-msvc`), which uses `MicrosoftRecordLayoutBuilder`; or applying `__attribute__((ms_struct))` to individual structs on any target, which activates the `IsMsStruct` path inside `ItaniumRecordLayoutBuilder`. GCC documents the rules under [`TARGET_MS_BITFIELD_LAYOUT_P`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Storage-Layout.html#:~:text=TARGET_MS_BITFIELD_LAYOUT_P).

The Microsoft ABI uses a fundamentally different layout strategy. While Itanium packs bit-fields into overlapping storage units of potentially different types, Microsoft allocates a **complete** storage unit of the declared type, then parcels bits among successive bit-fields **of the same type size**.

The key differences:

**Type size changes force a new storage unit.** In the GCC documentation's wording: "a bit-field won't share the same storage unit with the previous bit-field if their underlying types have different sizes, and the bit-field will be aligned to the highest alignment of the underlying types of itself and of the previous bit-field." Itanium would let them overlap.

```c
struct Itn { int a:24; short b:8; };                             // sizeof = 4
struct __attribute__((ms_struct)) MS { int a:24; short b:8; };   // sizeof = 8
```

Under Itanium, `b`'s `short` storage unit overlaps into `a`'s `int` unit — everything fits in 4 bytes. Under Microsoft, the type size changes from 4 to 2, so `b` gets its own storage unit. The `int` unit (4 bytes) plus the `short` unit (2 bytes, padded to 4 for alignment) gives 8 bytes. Note that the rule is about type _size_, not type identity — `int a:24; unsigned b:8` share a unit because both types are 4 bytes.

Each unit is discrete — this is a direct consequence of the type size rule.

**Zero-width bit-fields are ignored unless they follow a non-zero-width bit-field.** (`MicrosoftRecordLayoutBuilder::layoutZeroWidthBitField`.) GCC's documentation: "zero-sized bit-fields are disregarded unless they follow another nonzero-size bit-field." When honored, they terminate the current run and affect the struct's alignment.

```c
// MS mode:
struct MS_ZW1 { long : 0; char bar; };                       // sizeof = 1 (no preceding bit-field)
struct MS_ZW2 { char foo; int : 0; char bar; };              // sizeof = 2 (preceding non-bit-field doesn't count)
struct MS_ZW3 { int : 0; long : 0; char bar; };              // sizeof = 1 (zero-width doesn't count either)
struct MS_ZW4 { char foo : 4; int : 0; char bar; };          // sizeof = 8 (non-zero-width bit-field — honored)
struct MS_ZW5 { long : 0; char foo : 4; int : 0; char bar; };  // sizeof = 8 (first ignored, second honored)
```

**Alignment = type size.** The alignment of a fundamental type always equals its size — `alignof(long long) == 8` even on targets where the natural alignment is 4 (like Darwin PPC32).

**Unions.** ms_struct ignores all alignment attributes in unions. All bit-fields use alignment 1 and start at offset 0.

## Phase 2: Access Units

LLVM IR has no bit-field concept. To access a bit-field, the Clang-generated IR must:

1. )
2. Mask and shift to extract or insert the bit-field's bits
3. Store the integer back

The access unit is the LLVM type that gets loaded and stored. Choosing it well matters:

- Too narrow means multiple memory operations for adjacent bit-field writes;
- Too wide means touching memory unnecessarily or clobbering adjacent data.

Implementation: `CGRecordLowering::accumulateBitFields` (`clang/lib/CodeGen/CGRecordLayoutBuilder.cpp`).

### Itanium: Merging Algorithm

**Hard constraints** — an access unit must never:

1. The C memory model allows non-bit-field members to be accessed from other threads. A load/store of the access unit must not touch bytes belonging to other members.
2. at a byte boundary. Zero-width bit-fields define memory location boundaries — they are barriers.
3. In C++, a derived class may place fields in a non-POD base class's tail padding. The access unit must not overwrite those bytes.

**Soft goals** — subject to the hard constraints, access units should be:

- (1, 2, 4, 8 bytes). Non-power-of-2 sizes (e.g., 3 bytes) get lowered as multiple smaller loads plus bit manipulation.
- Avoids multi-register loads.
- (on strict-alignment targets). Avoids the compiler synthesizing unaligned access sequences.
- within the above. Fewer, wider accesses let LLVM combine adjacent bit-field writes into one read-modify-write.

**The algorithm: spans then merging.**

_Step 1 — Spans._ Bitfields that share a byte are inseparable. They form a minimal "span" that must be in the same access unit. A span is a maximal run of bit-fields where each successive one starts mid-byte.

Spans break at byte-aligned boundaries and at zero-width bit-field barriers. A field mid-byte is unconditionally part of the current span — step 2 never sees it as a merge point.

_Step 2 — Merge._ Starting from each span, try to widen the access unit by incorporating the next span. Accept the merge if the combined unit:

- )
- Is power-of-2 and naturally aligned (on strict-alignment targets)
- Doesn't cross a barrier (zero-width bit-field or non-bit-field storage)
- type fits before the limit offset

Track the best candidate and install it when merging can't improve further.

**Access unit representation.**

Clang represents each access unit as either an integer type `iN` or an array type `[N x i8]` (see `CGRecordLowering::accumulateBitFields`). `iN` is preferred — it generates a single load/store instruction. But LLVM's `iN` types have allocation sizes rounded up to powers of 2 (`DataLayout.getTypeAllocSize`). For example, `i24` has allocation size 4 bytes.

If that rounded-up size would extend past the next field or past reusable tail padding, the access unit is **clipped** to `[N x i8]`, which has an exact byte count. Clang assumes clipped for each new span (`BestClipped = true`) and sets it to false only when the natural `iN` fits within the available space (`BeginOffset + TypeSize <= LimitOffset`).

```c
// Tail padding reuse (C++)
struct A { int x:24; ~A(); };      // non-POD: DataSize=3, Size=4
struct B : A { char c; };          // c at offset 3, in A's tail padding

// i24 allocates 4 bytes, but byte 3 belongs to B::c.
// Access unit for x is clipped to [3 x i8].
```

**Strict vs cheap unaligned.** On targets with cheap unaligned access (x86, AArch64 without `+strict-align`), alignment checks are skipped — spans merge freely up to register width. On strict-alignment targets (e.g. `-mstrict-align`), a merge is rejected if the combined access unit would not be naturally aligned at its offset within the struct.

```c
struct Align { char x; short a:12; short b:4; char c:8; }; // sizeof = 6

// AArch64 -mno-strict-align:  %struct.S = type <{ i8, i8, i32 }>
//   → a+b+c merged into one i32 at offset 2 (unaligned, but cheap)
// AArch64 -mstrict-align:     %struct.S = type { i8, i16, i8 }
//   → a+b merged
//   → +c rejected; a+b stay as i16, c gets its own i8
```

**`-ffine-grained-bit-field-accesses`.** This Clang flag disables merging entirely. Each span becomes its own access unit — no adjacent spans are combined. For example:

```c
struct S4 { unsigned long f1:28, f2:4, f3:12; };
// Default:        %struct.S4 = type { i64 }       — spans merged into one access unit
// Fine-grained:   %struct.S4 = type { i32, i16 }  — each span kept separate
```

[The flag is incompatible with sanitizers](https://reviews.llvm.org/D36562) and is automatically disabled (with a warning) when any sanitizer is active.

Returning to S3:

```c
struct S3 { int a:10; int b:6; char c; int d:6; };
```

Phase 1 assigned: `a`@0, `b`@10, `c`@16 (byte 2), `d`@24 (byte 3).

Phase 2 sees two bit-field runs (separated by non-bit-field `c`):

_Run 1: `a` and `b`_ (bits 0–15, bytes 0–1). They share byte 1 (bits 8–15), so they form one span. The span covers 2 bytes. The natural type `i16` fits exactly — no clipping needed. Access unit: `i16`.

_Run 2: `d`_ (bits 24–29, byte 3). Single span, 6 bits in 1 byte. Access unit: `i8`.

The resulting LLVM struct type:

```plaintext
%struct.S3 = type { i16, i8, i8 }
                    a,b   c   d
```

To read `a`, codegen loads the `i16`, extracts bits 0–9. To read `b`, it loads the same `i16`, extracts bits 10–15. Neither load touches `c`.

**When clipping is needed.** Widen the bit-fields so `a + b` no longer fits in 2 bytes:

```c
struct S3w { int a:14; int b:10; char c; int d:6; };
```

Phase 1 assigned: `a`@0, `b`@14, `c`@24 (byte 3), `d`@32 (byte 4). `sizeof(S3w) = 8`.

_Run 1: `a` and `b`_ (bits 0–23, bytes 0–2). The span covers 3 bytes. The natural type `i24` has allocation size 4 bytes — but byte 3 belongs to `c`. The access unit is **clipped to `[3 x i8]`**.

_Run 2: `d`_ (bits 32–37, byte 4). Access unit: `i8`.

```plaintext
%struct.S3w = type { [3 x i8], i8, i8, [3 x i8] }
                      a,b       c    d    padding
```

**Endianness.**

Access unit selection is endianness-agnostic — spans, merging, and clipping all work in byte offsets from the start of the struct. Endianness matters only when codegen emits the shift/mask sequence to extract or insert a bitfield within its access unit.

LLVM loads an access unit as a single integer. On little-endian, bit 0 of the integer corresponds to the lowest-addressed byte's LSB — bitfield offsets from Phase 1 can be used directly as shift amounts. On big-endian, bit 0 of the integer corresponds to the highest-addressed byte's MSB, so the bit numbering within the loaded integer is reversed.

Clang handles this in `setBitFieldInfo` (`CGRecordLayoutBuilder.cpp`):

```cpp
Info.Offset = (unsigned)(getFieldBitOffset(FD) - Context.toBits(StartOffset));
// ...
if (DataLayout.isBigEndian())
  Info.Offset = Info.StorageSize - (Info.Offset + Info.Size);
```

The little-endian offset counts up from the LSB; the big-endian offset is mirrored to count down from the MSB. `EmitLoadOfBitfieldLValue` (`CGExpr.cpp`) then uses `Info.Offset` uniformly — it right-shifts by `Offset` and masks to `Size` bits, which works for both endiannesses because the flip was already baked into `Offset`.

### Microsoft: Discrete Access Units

Microsoft ABI's codegen is simple: each bit-field gets an access unit of its declared type. Adjacent bit-fields of the same type size share one access unit. Zero-width bit-fields and type-size changes break runs. There is no complex merging — the Phase 1 storage units _are_ the access units.

Contrast S3 under both ABIs:

```c
struct S3 { int a:10; int b:6; char c; int d:6; };
```

```plaintext
Itanium:   %struct.S3  = type { i16, i8, i8 }        // a,b merged into i16, d is i8
Microsoft: %struct.MS3 = type { i32, i8, i32 }       // a,b share i32 unit, d gets own i32
```

Itanium's Phase 2 merges `a` and `b` into the tightest access unit that covers both (`i16`), and clips or shrinks to avoid touching `c`. Microsoft uses the full declared type (`int` = `i32`) for each storage unit — no merging, no clipping.

Similarly for mixed types:

```c
struct S2 { int a:24; short b:8; };
```

```plaintext
Itanium:   %struct.S2  = type { i32 }                 // a and b merged into one i32
Microsoft: %struct.MS2 = type { i32, i16 }            // separate units: i32 for a, i16 for b
```

Itanium merges `a` and `b` into a single `i32` since they share the same 4 bytes. Microsoft gives each its own access unit matching the declared type.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 decides _where_ bits go — it's specified by the ABI and determines `sizeof` and `alignof`. Phase 2 decides _how_ to access them — it's a compiler optimization that affects codegen but not the binary layout. They answer different questions and often produce different-sized units. The storage unit for a bit-field is determined by its declared type; the access unit is determined by what's safe and efficient to load.
