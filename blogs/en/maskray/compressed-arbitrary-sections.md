# Compressed arbitrary sections

This article describes `SHF_ALLOC|SHF_COMPRESSED` sections in ELF and lld's linker option `--compress-sections` to compress arbitrary sections.

## .symtab and .strtab

In ELF executables and DSOs, `.symtab` and `.strtab` sections can consume a significant portion of the file size (10+% or even 20+%). In many scenarios, we cannot remove them due to symbolizers (crash reporters, Linux perf, etc) and other analysis tools. `.symtab` and `.strtab` might be present in the executable/DSO or a debug file (see [`.gnu_debuglink`](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-10-30-distribution-of-debug-information#gnu_debuglink)).

It's natural to compress the two sections using the standard `SHF_COMPRESSED` feature.

## Metadata sections

In recent years, metadata sections have gained more uses. Some users may find compression attractive if they weigh file sizes over decompression overhead.

Some metadata sections are non-`SHF_ALLOC`, like DWARF debug sections. They may be unused by a runtime library but provide additional information for an analysis tool to inspect the content.

Other metadata sections have the `SHF_ALLOC` flag and therefore are part of a `PT_LOAD` segment. When the program is executed, we will have both the compressed and uncompressed copies in memory. This may appear inefficient if the runtime library needs to allocate a buffer for the decompressed content. Why do some people accept this tradeoff? Well, they may prioritize file size or they simply accept this inefficiency.

Some factors may lean more toward compression.

- Some metadata sections are optional and may be used infrequently (think of debug sections).
- Some use cases allow for streaming decompression. They may build an in-memory data structure from the decompressed section content and can then discard the decompressed section.

Anyhow, compression is sometimes useful and designers may want to implement compression within the format. However, this would lead to duplicated code, considering that we have a generic feature at the object file format level: ELF `SHF_COMPRESSED`.

## `SHF_COMPRESSED` sections

[Compressed debug sections](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-01-23-compressed-debug-sections) I wrote last year describes `SHF_COMPRESSED`. Currently, its use cases are limited to debug sections.

Many ELF linkers provide `--compress-debug-sections=[zlib|zstd]` to compress `.debug_*` sections. This functionality can be extended to arbitrary sections. I filed a [GNU ld feature request](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27452) in 2021, and recently decided to push forward with the effort. I have implemented [[ELF] Add --compress-sections](https://reviews.llvm.org/D154641) in ld.lld.

My proposed syntax is `--compress-sections <section-glob>={none,zlib,zstd}[:level]`. If an output section matches the glob pattern, it will be compressed using the specified format: zlib or zstd. The compression level is `level` (if specified) or a default speed-focused level.

A natural question arises: if a `SHF_ALLOC` section is matched, should the linker compress the section?

## `SHF_ALLOC|SHF_COMPRESSED` sections

I believe the answer is yes. However, I have concerns regarding non-compliance with the ELF standard, as stated in the current generic ABI documentation:

> `SHF_COMPRESSED` - This flag identifies a section containing compressed data. `SHF_COMPRESSED` applies only to non-allocable sections, and cannot be used in conjunction with `SHF_ALLOC`. In addition, `SHF_COMPRESSED` cannot be applied to sections of type `SHT_NOBITS`.

I believe this restriction is unnecessary for all of relocatable object files, executables, and shared objects. Therefore, I have [proposed a change](https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/HUVhliUrTG0) in the generic-abi group to remove the incompatibility between `SHF_COMPRESSED` and `SHF_ALLOC` in the wording.

For `SHF_ALLOC|SHF_COMPRESSED` sections in relocatable object files, they are fine as long as the linker is capable of decompressing the content. It is also important to ensure that non-linker consumers are compatible with the section, which is relatively easy to confirm.

For linker output (executable or shared object), having both the `SHF_ALLOC` and `SHF_COMPRESSED` flags should be permissible. For example, we can use PC-relative relocations in a metadata section to reference text sections. These relocations will be resolved at link time. 1

.section .text.foo,"ax"

.section .text.bar,"ax"  
nop  
  
.section foo,"a"  
.p2align 3  
.quad .text.foo-.  
.quad .text.bar-.

Section headers are optional in executables and shared objects and are ignored by runtime loaders. The runtime loader does not require any special handling for the `SHF_COMPRESSED` flag.

When the program is executed, the runtime library responsible for the metadata section will allocate memory and decompress the section's content. Let's say `foo` has the address 0x201000 in memory. If we allocate the decompressed buffer at address 0x202000, we need to add the offset 0x201000-0x202000 = -0x1000 to the label differences in `foo`.

Section decompression imposes certain limitations on use cases.

First, the sections cannot have dynamic sections. Relocation offsets are relative to the decompressed section instead of the compressed section. However, the runtime loader doesn't know there are compressed sections, so it would blindly apply the relocation. In the common case that the compressed section is smaller, the runtime loader will modify bytes in a subsequent section or an unmapped address, leading to runtime crashes or corruption of writable data sections.

In general, absolute references should be replaced with label differences. 1

.section foo.wrong,"a"  
.p2align 3  
.quad .text.foo # wrong  
.quad .text.bar # wrong

Second, a symbol defined relative to an input section designate an offset relative to the compressed content. If the program tries to read the content at the symbol, it will load a random location from the compressed content or another section. Similar to the arithmetic example above (0x201000-0x202000 = -0x1000), the runtime library may adjust the symbol value by `addr(compressed)-addr(decompressed)` to obtain an offset relative to the decompressed content. If there are two symbols defined relative to one or two input sections, taking the difference can be more convenient.

Third, there is a circular dependency between the compressed section content and the section layout.

- The uncompressed section content decides the compressed section size.
- The compressed section size affects addresses of subsequent sections and symbol assignments. The affected sections include text sections that use range extension thunks.
- Subsequent sections and symbol assignments may affect the uncompressed section content.

    - PC-relative references to text sections (e.g., `.quad .text.foo-.`) change values when the text section address changes.
    - data commands in an output section description may change.
    - location counter increments (e.g., `. += expr;`) in an output section description may change.

```plaintext
SECTIONS {
  ...
  foo : { *(foo*) QUAD(expr1) . += expr2; }
}
```

If the linker compresses the section content at one step, the compressed content will be invalidated when the section content or size changes.

A sophisticated implementation can run compression and section content/size computation iteratively in a loop. In my ld.lld implementation, I just compute the uncompressed section size and content once, apply compression, and then perform other computations that need to be done iteratively. Since most metadata sections don't need an output section description using a linker script, I believe the limitation is acceptable.

### Strip

`SHF_ALLOC` provides protection from strip, which can be seen as a secondary benefit. I think it is valuable in practice, as linking and stripping are separate steps, and the developers may have less control on the strip side.

In the GNU world, I think distributions have some strip option requirement/restriction. Therefore, there was even a post [using section flags to indicate stripable or persistent sections](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/gnu-gabi/2022q4/000508.html) discussing whether we want a section flag to avoid stripping.

## Discerning between compressed and uncompressed sections

The runtime library can identify the section content with a pair of encapsulation symbols `__start_<sectionname>` and `__stop_<sectionname>`. These symbols are defined relative to the output section. In my ld.lld implementation, `__stop_<sectionname> - __start_<sectionname>` equals the compressed section size.

Note: if we use linker scripts to define a symbol in the middle of the output section, it will not have clear semantics. Such constructs should be avoided.

The content at `__start_<sectionname>` may be uncompressed starting with a regular metadata section header or compressed starting with an `Elf32_Chdr`/`Elf64_Chdr` header.

```plaintext
typedef struct {
  Elf64_Word	ch_type;	    // Compression format
  Elf64_Word	ch_reserved;
  Elf64_Xword	ch_size;	    // Uncompressed data size
  Elf64_Xword	ch_addralign;   // Uncompressed data alignment
} Elf64_Chdr;
```

The metadata section header may start with a magic number. In practice, `ch_type` can only be 1 (`ELFCOMPRESS_ZLIB`) or 2 (`ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD`). When I added `ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD`, https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/satyPkuMisk/m/xRqMj8M3AwAJ I acknowledged that we did not intend to include a plethora of formats. So even if we want to be a good ELF citizen and don't collide with future ELF extensions, there are still numerous values available for allocation.

While there is a slight risk of collision, it is not a significant cause for concern. Metadata sections generally faces fewer backward compatibility restrictions since prebuilt libraries with specific instrumentation are considered awkward and therefore uncommon. In the super rare circumstance that the metadata section header collides with an `Elf32_Chdr`/`Elf64_Chdr` header, we can update the metadata section header.

You may read the first paragraph of [C++ standard library ABI compatibility](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-06-25-c++-standard-library-abi-compatibility) where I describe different compatibility guarantees. In reality, for many metadata sections, mixing different versions are unsupported. If they work for a user mixing different versions, it's great. If not, the user should know that the onus is on their side.

## Other object file formats

The description has primarily focused on ELF, which is the most widely used object file format for server platforms. Many metadata sections are designed specifically for ELF and prioritize it as the primary platform.

In contrast, PE/COFF and Mach-O, while popular in their respective operating systems, have comparatively lower demand for certain metadata features. However, it would be beneficial if these formats also supported a generic section compression feature.

Designing metadata sections can be challenging due to limitations in PE/COFF and Mach-O. For instance, COFF ARM64 does not support `IMAGE_REL_ARM64_REL64`. As a workaround, my [https://reviews.llvm.org/D104564](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104564) introduced the use of `.quad .text.foo-.`. Mach-O requires atoms (non-temporary labels) as separators for subsections.
