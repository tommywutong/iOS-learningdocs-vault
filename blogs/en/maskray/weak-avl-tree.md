# Weak AVL Tree

tl;dr: Weak AVL trees are replacements for AVL trees and red-black trees.

The 2014 paper [_Rank-Balanced Trees_](https://sidsen.azurewebsites.net/papers/rb-trees-talg.pdf) (Haeupler, Sen, Tarjan) presents a framework using ranks and rank differences to define binary search trees.

- Each node has a non-negative integer rank `r(x)`. Null nodes have rank -1.
- The rank difference of a node `x` with parent `p(x)` is `r(p(x)) − r(x)`.
- A node is `i,j` if its children have rank differences `i` and `j` (unordered), e.g., a 1,2 node has children with rank differences 1 and 2.
- A node is called 1-node if its rank difference is 1.

Several balanced trees fit this framework:

- AVL tree: Ranks are defined as heights. Every node is 1,1 or 1,2 (rank differences of children)
- Red-Black tree: All rank differences are 0 or 1, and no parent of a 0-child is a 0-child. (red: 0-child; black: 1-child; null nodes are black)
- Weak AVL tree (new tree described by this paper): All rank differences are 1 or 2, and every leaf has rank 0.

    - A weak AVL tree without 2,2 nodes is an AVL tree.

## Weak AVL Tree

Weak AVL trees are replacements for AVL trees and red-black trees. A single insertion or deletion operation requires at most two rotations (forming a double rotation when two are needed). In contrast, AVL deletion requires O(log n) rotations, and red-black deletion requires up to three.

Without deletions, a weak AVL tree is exactly an AVL tree. With deletions, its height remains at most that of an AVL tree with the same number of insertions but no deletions.

The rank rules imply:

- Null nodes have rank -1, leaves have rank 0, unary nodes have rank 1.

### Insertion

The new node `x` has a rank of 0, changed from the null node of rank -1. There are three cases.

- If the tree was previously empty, the new node becomes the root.
- If the parent of the new node was previously a unary node (1,2 node), it is now a 1,1 binary node.
- If the parent of the new node was previously a leaf (1,1 node), it is now a 0,1 binary node, leading to a rank violation.

When the tree was previously non-empty, `x` has a parent node. We call the following subroutine with `x` indicating the new node to handle the second and third cases.

The following subroutine handles the rank increase of `x`. We call `break` if there is no more rank violation, i.e. we are done.

The 2014 paper isn't very clear about the conditions.

```cpp
// Assume that x's rank has just increased by 1 and rank_diff(x) has been updated.

p = x->parent;
if (rank_diff(x) == 1) {
  // x was previously a 2-child before increasing x->rank.
  // Done.
} else {
  for (;;) {
    // Otherwise, p is a 0,1 node (previously a 1,1 node before increasing x->rank).
    // x being a 0-child is a violation.

    Promote p.
    // Since we have promoted both x and p, it's as if rank_diff(x's sibling) is flipped.
    // p is now a 1,2 node.

    x = p;
    p = p->parent;
    // x is a 1,2 node.
    if (!p) break;
    d = p->ch[1] == x;

    if (rank_diff(x) == 1) { break; }
    // Otherwise, x is a 0-child, leading to a new rank violation.

    auto sib = p->ch[!d];
    if (rank_diff(sib) == 2) { // p is a 0,2 node
      auto y = x->ch[d^1];
      if (y && rank_diff(y) == 1) {
        // y is a 1-child. y must the previous `x` in the last iteration.
        Perform a double rotation involving `p`, `x`, and `y`.
      } else {
        // Otherwise, y is null or a 2-child.
        Perform a single rotation involving `p` and `x`.
        x is now a 1,1 node and there is no more violation.
      }
      break;
    }

    // Otherwise, p is a 0,1 node. Goto the next iteration.
  }
}
```

Insertion never introduces a 2,2 node, so insertion-only sequences produce AVL trees.

### Deletion

TODO: Describe deletion

```plaintext
if (!was_2 && !x && !p->ch[0] && !p->ch[1] && p->rp()) {
  // p was unary and becomes 2,2. Demote it.
}
```

### Implementation

Since valid rank differences can only be 1 or 2, ranks can be encoded efficiently using bit flags. There are three approaches:

- Store two bits representing the rank differences to each child. Bit 0: rank difference to left child (1 = diff is 2, 0 = diff is 1). Bit 1: rank difference to right child
- Store a single bit representing the parity (even/odd) of the node's absolute rank. The rank difference to a child is computed by comparing parities. Same parity → rank difference of 2. Different parity → rank difference of 1
- Store a 1-bit rank difference parity in each node.

FreeBSD's `sys/tree.h` ([https://reviews.freebsd.org/D25480](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D25480), 2020) uses the first approach. The `rb_` prefix remains as it can also indicate `Rank-Balanced`:) Note: its insertion operation can be futher optimized as the following code demonstrates.

[https://github.com/pvachon/wavl_tree](https://github.com/pvachon/wavl_tree) and [https://crates.io/crates/wavltree](https://crates.io/crates/wavltree) use the second approach.

The third approach is less efficient because a null node can be either a 1-child (parent is binary) or a 2-child (parent is unary), requiring the sibling node to be probed to determine the rank difference: `int rank_diff(Node *p, int d) { return p->ch[d] ? p->ch[d]->par_and_flg & 1 : p->ch[!d] ? 2 : 1; }`

[https://maskray.me/blog/2025-12-14-weak-avl-tree](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-12-14-weak-avl-tree) is a C++ implementation covering both approaches, supporting the following operations:

- `insert`: insert a node
- `remove`: remove a node
- `rank`: count elements less than a key
- `select`: find the k-th smallest element (0-indexed)
- `prev`: find the largest element less than a key
- `next`: find the smallest element greater than a key

**Node structure:**

- `ch[2]`: left and right child pointers.
- `par_and_flg`: packs the parent pointer with 2 flag bits in the low bits. Bit 0 indicates whether the left child has rank difference 2; bit 1 indicates whether the right child has rank difference 2. A cleared bit means rank difference 1.
- `i`: the key value.
- `sum`, `size`: augmented data maintained by `mconcat` for order statistics operations.

**Helper methods:**

- `rd2(d)`: returns true if child `d` has rank difference 2.
- `flip(d)`: toggles the rank difference of child `d` between 1 and 2.
- `clr_flags()`: sets both children to rank difference 1 (used after rotations to reset a node to 1,1).

**Invariants:**

- Leaves always have `flags() == 0`, meaning both null children are 1-children (null nodes have rank -1, leaf has rank 0).
- After each insertion or deletion, `mconcat` is called along the path to the root to update augmented data.

**Rotations:**

The `rotate(x, d)` function rotates node `x` in direction `d`. It lifts `x->ch[d]` to replace `x`, and updates the augmented data for `x`. The caller is responsible for updating rank differences.
