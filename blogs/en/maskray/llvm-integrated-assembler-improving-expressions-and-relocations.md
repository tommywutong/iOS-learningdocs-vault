# LLVM integrated assembler: Improving expressions and relocations

In my previous post, [LLVM integrated assembler: Improving MCExpr and MCValue](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-04-06-llvm-integrated-assembler-improving-mcexpr-mcvalue) delved into enhancements made to LLVM's internal MCExpr and MCValue representations. This post covers recent refinements to MC, focusing on expression resolving and relocation generation.

## Preventing cyclic dependencies

[Equated symbols](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-05-08-assemblers#symbol-equating-directives) may form a cycle, which is not allowed.

```plaintext
# CHECK: [[#@LINE+2]]:7: error: cyclic dependency detected for symbol 'a'
# CHECK: [[#@LINE+1]]:7: error: expression could not be evaluated
a = a + 1

# CHECK: [[#@LINE+3]]:6: error: cyclic dependency detected for symbol 'b1'
# CHECK: [[#@LINE+1]]:6: error: expression could not be evaluated
b0 = b1
b1 = b2
b2 = b0
```

Previously, LLVM's interated assembler used an occurs check to detect these cycles when parsing symbol equating directives.

```cpp
bool parseAssignmentExpression(StringRef Name, bool allow_redef,
                               MCAsmParser &Parser, MCSymbol *&Sym,
                               const MCExpr *&Value) {
  ...
  // Validate that the LHS is allowed to be a variable (either it has not been
  // used as a symbol, or it is an absolute symbol).
  Sym = Parser.getContext().lookupSymbol(Name);
  if (Sym) {
    // Diagnose assignment to a label.
    //
    // FIXME: Diagnostics. Note the location of the definition as a label.
    // FIXME: Diagnose assignment to protected identifier (e.g., register name).
    if (Value->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym))
      return Parser.Error(EqualLoc, "Recursive use of '" + Name + "'");
    ...
  }
```

`isSymbolUsedInExpression` implemented occurs check as a tree (or more accurately, a DAG) traversal.

```cpp
bool MCExpr::isSymbolUsedInExpression(const MCSymbol *Sym) const {
  switch (getKind()) {
  case MCExpr::Binary: {
    const MCBinaryExpr *BE = static_cast<const MCBinaryExpr *>(this);
    return BE->getLHS()->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym) ||
           BE->getRHS()->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym);
  }
  case MCExpr::Target: {
    const MCTargetExpr *TE = static_cast<const MCTargetExpr *>(this);
    return TE->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym);
  }
  case MCExpr::Constant:
    return false;
  case MCExpr::SymbolRef: {
    const MCSymbol &S = static_cast<const MCSymbolRefExpr *>(this)->getSymbol();
    if (S.isVariable() && !S.isWeakExternal())
      return S.getVariableValue()->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym);
    return &S == Sym;
  }
  case MCExpr::Unary: {
    const MCExpr *SubExpr =
        static_cast<const MCUnaryExpr *>(this)->getSubExpr();
    return SubExpr->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym);
  }
  }

  llvm_unreachable("Unknown expr kind!");
}
```

While generally effective, this routine wasn't universally applied across all symbol equating scenarios, such as with `.weakref` or some target-specific parsing code, leading to potential undetected cycles, and therefore infinite loop in assembler execution.

To address this, I adopted a 2-color depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. While a 3-color DFS is typical for DAGs, a 2-color approach suffices for our trees, although this might lead to more work when a symbol is visited multiple times. Shared subexpressions are very rare in LLVM.

Here is the relevant change to `evaluateAsRelocatableImpl`. I also need a new bit from `MCSymbol`.

```patch

```

Unfortunately, I cannot remove `MCExpr::isSymbolUsedInExpression`, as it is still used by AMDGPU ([[AMDGPU] Avoid resource propagation for recursion through multiple functions](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/112251)).

## Revisiting the `.weakref` directive

The .weakref directive had intricate impact on the expression resolving framework.

`.weakref` enables the creation of weak aliases without directly modifying the target symbol's binding. This allows a header file in library A to optionally depend on symbols from library B. When the target symbol is otherwise not referenced, the object file affected by the weakref directive will include an undefined weak symbol. However, when the target symbol is defined or referenced (by the user), it can retain STB_GLOBAL binding to support archive member extraction. GCC's `[[gnu::weakref]]` attribute, as used in runtime library headers like `libgcc/gthr-posix.h`, utilizes this feature.

I've noticed a few issues:

- Unreferenced `.weakref alias, target` created undefined `target`.
- Crash when `alias` was already defined.
- `VK_WEAKREF` was mis-reused by the `alias` directive of llvm-ml (MASM replacement).

And addressed them with

- [[MC] Ignore VK_WEAKREF in MCValue::getAccessVariant](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/2b0256e49bbe5c0dc9c8f4800b1e2f131026cb45) (2019-12). Wow, it's interesting to realize I'd actually delved into this a few years ago!
- [MC: Rework .weakref](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/95756e67c230c231c616a9aeabc2eea1e2831829) (2025-05)

## Expression resolving and reassignments

`=` and its equivalents (`.set`, `.equ`) allow a symbol to be [equated](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-05-08-assemblers#symbol-equating-directives) multiple times. This means when a symbol is referenced, its current value is captured at that moment, and subsequent reassignments do not alter prior references.

```plaintext
.data
.set x, 0
.long x         // reference the first instance
x = .-.data
.long x         // reference the second instance
.set x,.-.data
.long x         // reference the third instance
```

The assembly code evaluates to `.long 0; .long 4; .long 8`.

Historically, the LLVM integrated assembler restricted reassigning symbols whose value wasn't a parse-time integer constant (`MCConstExpr`). This was a safeguard against potentially unsafe reassignments, as an old value might still be referenced.

```plaintext
% clang -c g.s
g.s:6:8: error: invalid reassignment of non-absolute variable 'x'
.set x,.-.data
       ^
```

The safeguard was implemented with multiple conditions, aided by a [mysterious](https://reviews.llvm.org/D12347) [`IsUsed`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/9b4a824217f1fe23f83045afe7521acb791bc2d0) variable.

```cpp
// Diagnose assignment to a label.
//
// FIXME: Diagnostics. Note the location of the definition as a label.
// FIXME: Diagnose assignment to protected identifier (e.g., register name).
if (Value->isSymbolUsedInExpression(Sym))
  return Parser.Error(EqualLoc, "Recursive use of '" + Name + "'");
else if (Sym->isUndefined(/*SetUsed*/ false) && !Sym->isUsed() &&
         !Sym->isVariable())
  ; // Allow redefinitions of undefined symbols only used in directives.
else if (Sym->isVariable() && !Sym->isUsed() && allow_redef)
  ; // Allow redefinitions of variables that haven't yet been used.
else if (!Sym->isUndefined() && (!Sym->isVariable() || !allow_redef))
  return Parser.Error(EqualLoc, "redefinition of '" + Name + "'");
else if (!Sym->isVariable())
  return Parser.Error(EqualLoc, "invalid assignment to '" + Name + "'");
else if (!isa<MCConstantExpr>(Sym->getVariableValue()))
  return Parser.Error(EqualLoc,
                      "invalid reassignment of non-absolute variable '" +
                          Name + "'");
```

Over the past few years, during our work on porting Clang to Linux kernel ports, we worked around this by modifying the assembly code itself:

- [ARM: 8971/1: replace the sole use of a symbol with its definition](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a780e485b5768e78aef087502499714901b68cc4) in 2020-04
- [crypto: aesni - add compatibility with IAS](https://git.kernel.org/linus/44069737ac9625a0f02f0f7f5ab96aae4cd819bc) in 2020-07
- [powerpc/64/asm: Do not reassign labels](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d72c4a36d7ab560127885473a310ece28988b604) in 2021-12

This prior behavior wasn't ideal. I've since enabled proper reassignment by implementing a system where the symbol is cloned upon redefinition, and the symbol table is updated accordingly. Crucially, any existing references to the original symbol remain unchanged, and the original symbol is no longer included in the final emitted symbol table.

Before rolling out this improvement, I discovered problematic uses in the AMDGPU and ARM64EC backends that required specific fixes or workarounds. This is a common challenge when making general improvements to LLVM's MC layer: you often need to untangle and resolve individual backend-specific "hacks" before a more generic interface enhancement can be applied.

- [MCParser: Error when .set reassigns a non-redefinable variable](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/76ee2d34f787357eec1a5dec16b294578151881e)
- [MC: Allow .set to reassign non-MCConstantExpr expressions](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e015626f189dc76f8df9fdc25a47638c6a2f3feb)

For the following assembly, newer Clang emits relocations referencing `foo, foo, bar, foo` like GNU Assembler.

```plaintext
b = a
a = foo
call a
call b
a = bar
call a
call b
```

## Relocation generation

For a deeper dive into the concepts of relocation generation, you might find my previous post, [Relocation generation in assemblers](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-03-16-relocation-generation-in-assemblers), helpful.

Driven by the need to support new RISC-V vendor relocations (e.g., Xqci extensions from Qualcomm) and my preference against introducing an extra `MCAsmBackend` hook, I've significantly refactored LLVM's relocation generation framework. This effort generalized existing RISC-V/LoongArch ADD/SUB relocation logic and enabled its customization for other targets like AVR and PowerPC.

- [MC: Generalize RISCV/LoongArch handleAddSubRelocations and AVR shouldForceRelocation](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c512d951861c9e35649b6c9672c227244bb9b6be)

The linker relaxation framework sometimes generated redundant relocations that could have been resolved. This occurred in several scenarios, including:

```plaintext
.option norelax
j label
// For assembly input, RISCVAsmParser::ParseInstruction sets ForceRelocs (https://reviews.llvm.org/D46423).
// For direct object emission, RISCVELFStreamer sets ForceRelocs (#77436)
.option relax
call foo  // linker-relaxable

.option norelax
j label   // redundant relocation due to ForceRelocs
.option relax

label:
```

And also with label differences within a section without linker-relaxable instructions:

```plaintext
call foo

.section .text1,"ax"
# No linker-relaxable instruction. Label differences should be resolved.
w1:
  nop
w2:

.data
# Redundant R_RISCV_SET32 and R_RISCV_SUB32
.long w2-w1
```

These issues have now been resolved through a series of patches, significantly revamping the target-neutral relocation generation framework. Key contributions include:

- [[MC] Refactor fixup evaluation and relocation generation](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/5d87ebf3ade73d43b2dc334e4d23bc86ddc47879)
- [RISCV,LoongArch: Encode RELAX relocation implicitly](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/140494)
- [RISCV: Remove shouldForceRelocation and unneeded relocations](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/140692)
- [MC: Remove redundant relocations for label differences](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/b754e4085541df750c51677e522dd939e2aa9e2d)

I've also streamlined relocation generation within the SPARC backend. Given its minimal number of relocations, the SPARC implementation could serve as a valuable reference for downstream targets seeking to customize their own relocation handling.

## Simplification to assembly and machine code emission

For a dive into the core classes involved in LLVM's assembly and machine code emission, you might read my [Notes on LLVM assembly and machine code emission](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-05-08-assemblers#notes-on-llvm-assembly-and-machine-code-emission).

The `MCAssembler` class orchestrates the emission process, managing `MCAsmBackend`, `MCCodeEmitter`, and `MCObjectWriter`. In turn, `MCObjectWriter` oversees `MCObjectTargetWriter`.

Historically, many member functions within the subclasses of `MCAsmBackend`, `MCObjectWriter`, and `MCObjectTargetWriter` accepted a `MCAssembler *` argument. This was often redundant, as it was typically only used to access the `MCContext` instance. To streamline this, I've added a `MCAssembler *` member variable directly to `MCAsmBackend`, `MCObjectWriter`, and `MCObjectTargetWriter`, along with convenient helper functions like `getContext`. This change cleans up the interfaces and improves code clarity.

- [MCAsmBackend: Add member variable MCAssembler * and define getContext](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/84f06b88b64352e35fc8363081e58fd37e326452)
- [ELFObjectWriter: Remove the MCContext argument from getRelocType](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/fe32806d67eef72ff406dbcdc6a28d882a00e3a3)
- [MachObjectWriter: Remove the MCAssembler argument from getSymbolAddress](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/1193f62f7c19e4e0cc36ee5006fa27ec108dc466)
- [WinCOFFObjectWriter: Simplify code with member MCAssembler *](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/9513284f25545029de68f7e09bc5c1606636c489)

Previously, the ARM, Hexagon, and RISC-V backends had unique requirements that led to extra arguments being passed to MCAsmBackend hooks. These arguments were often unneeded by other targets. I've since refactored these interfaces, replacing those specialized arguments with more generalized and cleaner approaches.

- [ELFObjectWriter: Move Thumb-specific condition to ARMELFObjectWriter](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/63adf075551221901cee551af101a484234fd1f2)
- [MCAsmBackend: Remove MCSubtargetInfo argument](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/f0ff2bea75f45a72143ac7fcd16a1199eb5ebf6e)

- [MCAsmBackend,Hexagon: Remove MCRelaxableFragment from fixupNeedsRelaxationAdvanced](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/2ff226ae2c9bdafc686d698b69b4a8519213f325)
- [MCAsmBackend: Simplify applyFixup](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/871b0a32216770b84fe6fed412610ad03dafbf7f)

## Future plan

The assembler's ARM port has a limitation where only relocations with implicit addends (REL) are handled. For [CREL](https://maskray.me/blog/2024-03-09-a-compact-relocation-format-for-elf), we aim to use explicit addends across all targets to simplify linker/tooling implementation, but this is incompatible with `ARMAsmBackend`'s current design. See this ARM CREL assembler issue [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/141678](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/141678).

To address this issue, we should

- In `MCAssembler::evaluateFixup`, generalize `MCFixupKindInfo::FKF_IsAlignedDownTo32Bits` (ARM hack, also used by other backends) to support more fixups, including `ARM::fixup_arm_uncondbl` (`R_ARM_CALL`). Create a new hook in `MCAsmBackend`.
- In `ARMAsmBackend`, move the `Value -= 8` code from `adjustFixupValue` to the new hook.

```cpp
unsigned ARMAsmBackend::adjustFixupValue(const MCAssembler &Asm,
...
  case ARM::fixup_arm_condbranch:
  case ARM::fixup_arm_uncondbranch:
  case ARM::fixup_arm_uncondbl:
  case ARM::fixup_arm_condbl:
  case ARM::fixup_arm_blx:
    // Check that the relocation value is legal.
    Value -= 8;
    if (!isInt<26>(Value)) {
      Ctx.reportError(Fixup.getLoc(), "Relocation out of range");
      return 0;
```

Enabling RELA/CREL support requires significant effort and exceeds my expertise or willingness to address for AArch32. However, I do want to add a new MCAsmBackend hook to minimize AArch32's invasive modifications to the generic relocation generation framework.

For reference, the arm-vxworks port in binutils [introduced RELA support in 2006](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2006-March/046211.html).
