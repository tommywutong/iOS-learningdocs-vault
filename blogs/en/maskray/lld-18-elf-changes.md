# lld 18 ELF changes

LLVM 18 will be released. As usual, I maintain lld/ELF and have added some notes to [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/18.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/18.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst). I've meticulously reviewed nearly all the patches that are not authored by me. I'll delve into some of the key changes.

- `--fat-lto-objects` option is added to support LLVM FatLTO. Without `--fat-lto-objects`, LLD will link LLVM FatLTO objects using the relocatable object file. (`D146778 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D146778>`_)
- `-Bsymbolic-non-weak` is added to directly bind non-weak definitions. ([D158322](https://reviews.llvm.org/D158322))
- `--lto-validate-all-vtables-have-type-infos`, which complements `--lto-whole-program-visibility`, is added to disable unsafe whole-program devirtualization. `--lto-known-safe-vtables=<glob>` can be used to mark known-safe vtable symbols. ([D155659](https://reviews.llvm.org/D155659))
- `--save-temps --lto-emit-asm` now derives ELF/asm file names from bitcode file names. `ld.lld --save-temps a.o d/b.o -o out` will create ELF relocatable files `out.lto.a.o`/`d/out.lto.b.o` instead of `out1.lto.o`/`out2.lto.o`. ([#78835](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/78835))
- `--no-allow-shlib-undefined` now reports errors for DSO referencing non-exported definitions. ([#70769](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/70769))
- common-page-size can now be larger than the system page-size. ([#57618](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57618))
- When call graph profile information is available due to instrumentation or sample PGO, input sections are now sorted using the new `cdsort` algorithm, better than the previous `hfsort` algorithm. ([D152840](https://reviews.llvm.org/D152840))
- Symbol assignments like `a = DEFINED(a) ? a : 0;` are now handled. ([#65866](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/65866))
- `OVERLAY` now supports optional start address and LMA ([#77272](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/77272))
- Relocations referencing a symbol defined in `/DISCARD/` section now lead to an error. ([#69295](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/69295))
- For AArch64 MTE, global variable descriptors have been implemented. ([D152921](https://reviews.llvm.org/D152921))
- `R_AARCH64_GOTPCREL32` is now supported. ([#72584](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/72584))
- `R_LARCH_PCREL20_S2`/`R_LARCH_ADD6`/`R_LARCH_CALL36` and extreme code model relocations are now supported.
- `--emit-relocs` is now supported for RISC-V linker relaxation. ([D159082](https://reviews.llvm.org/D159082))
- Call relaxation respects RVC when mixing +c and -c relocatable files. ([#73977](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/73977))
- `R_RISCV_GOT32_PCREL` is now supported. ([#72587](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/72587))
- `R_RISCV_SET_ULEB128`/`R_RISCV_SUB_ULEB128` relocations are now supported. ([#72610](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/72610)) ([#77261](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/77261))
- RISC-V TLSDESC is now supported. ([#79239](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/79239))
- SystemZ (s390x) is now supported. ([#75643](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/75643))

Although a substantial feature, the s390x port benefited from Ulrich Weigand's meticulously prepared patch, complete with comprehensive tests from the outset. While I typically provide extensive feedback for such large additions, the patch's exceptional quality minimized the number of comment rounds needed in this instance. I truly appreciate Ulrich taking the time to reply to [my remarks on the s390x ABI](https://maskray.me/blog/2024-02-11-toolchain-notes-on-z-architecture). His guidance was instrumental.

The RISC-V port has received a few new relocations for `.uleb128` label differences and TLSDESC. I'm glad I made these assembler and linker changes in time, allowing LoongArch developers to port the code for LoongArch. LoongArch borrows many designs from RISC-V. If they were to implement these features first, I'd probably have to spend more time on code reviews, and the outcome would be less rewarding since I wouldn't be the original patch author.

`R_AARCH64_GOTPCREL32` (`G(GDAT(S))+A-P`) and `R_RISCV_GOT32_PCREL`, similar to `R_X86_64_GOTPCREL`, are new ABI additions used to optimize preemptible `_ZTI*` symbol references for `clang -fexperimental-relative-c++-abi-vtables`. The simplification utilizes the [optimization originally done for Mach-O](https://reviews.llvm.org/D6922), which applies to GOT equivalent global variables (global unnamed, constant, discardable linkage). 1

To the best of my knowledge, there is no performance-specific change.
