# My involvement with LLVM 17

LLVM 17 will soon be relased. This post provides a summary of my contributions in this release cycle to record my learning progress.

- Ported [`-fsanitize=function`](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-12-18-control-flow-integrity#fsanitizefunction) to non-x86 architectures and the C language.
- lld maintenance. See [lld 17 ELF changes](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-07-30-lld-17-elf-changes)
- LLVM binary utility maintenance, e.g.

    - [adopted llvm-readobj style ObjectFile specific dumpers](https://reviews.llvm.org/D155045)
    - [`[llvm-objdump][X86] Add @plt symbols for .plt.got`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D149817)
    - [`[llvm-readobj] Print <null> for relocation target with an empty name`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D155353)
- compiler-rt maintenance, e.g.

    - changed lsan to work with high-entropy ASLR for x86-64 Linux
    - [removed crypt and crypt_r interceptors](https://reviews.llvm.org/D149403) to work with glibc
    - [implemented interceptors](https://reviews.llvm.org/D158943) for glibc 2.38 `__isoc23_strtol` and `__isoc23_scanf` family functions
- Fixed ~20 places where the iteration order of `MapVector` or `SetVector` was relied on. [Proposed](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/reverse-iteration-bots/72224) more `LLVM_ENABLE_REVERSE_ITERATION=on` coverage
- Fixed longstanding brittle assembler support for RISC-V linker relaxation
- adapted a simplified 64-bit xxh3 from [Cyan4973/xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)

    - as efficient as the reference implementation for lld's purpose
    - migrated various xxhash64 uses in the repository
- XRay maintenance, e.g.

    - Implemented `__xray_customevent`/`__xray_typedevent` for AArch64
    - Changed codegen to work with Mach-O. Though the runtime part requires some CMake (which I lack) expertise to move more progress
    - Fixed semantics of some obscure driver options
- gcov maintenance
- Helped improving featuress like `-fexperimental-sanitize-metadata=`, `-fpseudo-probe-for-profiling`, and [`-fsanitize=kcfi`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D154125)

## MC

- Removed many obsoleted workarounds from the integrated assembler
- Fixed placement of function entry comments
- Re-architectured a substantial part of the integrated assembler that is used by RISC-V linker relaxation, fixing some longstanding bugs. See [The dark side of RISC-V linker relaxation](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-03-14-the-dark-side-of-riscv-linker-relaxation) for detail.

## Clang

Driver

- Made output files more meaningful when combining compilation and linking phases for certain options: `-gsplit-dwarf`, `-ftime-trace`, `--coverage`. See [Compiler output files](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-04-25-compiler-output-files) for detail
- made [target-specific option](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-08-25-clang-wunused-command-line-argument#target-specific-options) report an error when used with a different target. Previously Clang [merely issued warnings](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64632) like `warning: argument unused during compilation: '-msse' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]`
- `-fdebug-prefix-map=`: made the last win when multiple prefixes match
- [added `-mllvm=`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D143325) as an alias for `-mllvm`
- Downgraded `riscv*-` triples to `-fdebug-default-version=4` due to [linker-relaxation complexity](https://reviews.llvm.org/D157663)

Others:

- [[CodeGen] Support bitcode input containing multiple modules](https://reviews.llvm.org/D154923)

## Learning plan

I shall learn more about instrumentation related technologies and code generation.

## Code review

At the present, LLVM uses a self-hosted Phabricator for code review. I have accepted or rejected 381 Phabricator Differentials revisions (patches) during the 181 days. (I will mention how I get this number later.) I hope that the number is fabulous, considering so many other tasks I have to do at work for bread and butter. Here is an incomplete list:

- [unified LTO](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123804) (`clang -funified-lto`)
- [fat LTO](https://reviews.llvm.org/D146777) (`clang -ffat-lto-objects`) (pulled out from the 17.x release to avoid an incomplete state)
- [many lld features](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-07-30-lld-17-elf-changes)
- revamp of sanitizer interceptors
- [`-gsplit-dwarf` for Windows](https://reviews.llvm.org/D152785)
- [RISC-V `-fsanitize=kcfi`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148385).
- RISC-V patches related to assembler, linker, and psABI
- [`llvm-objdump -d` for BPF](https://reviews.llvm.org/D149058)
- LLVMSupport patches
- Mips and LoongArch patches

## Future of LLVM code review process

In June 2023, a [full disk issue](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/phabricator-unhandled-exception-aphrontqueryexception/71570) occurred with the server, which led to the rejection of new patch uploads. To address this problem, I expanded the database disk size from 500GB to 600GB, helping to mitigate the issue.

Phabricator is [winding down](https://admin.phacility.com/phame/post/view/11/phacility_is_winding_down_operations/). Maintaining a website with over 600K lines of PHP code is not sustainable. As a result, our community is in need of a suitable replacement and GitHub's pull request system have been selected as the replacement. I belong to the group that shares concerns regarding the quality of GitHub's pull request system, as it utilizes a model that some consider flawed.

GitHub's pull request system tightly couples a pull request with a branch and has a poor commit tracking ability. In short, the system [shoehorns into less flexible and less desired workflows](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2020/01/07/problems-with-pull-requests-and-how-to-fix-them/).

> If commits are reordered or added or removed in the middle of an existing series, the tool can get confused quite easily.
> 
> [...]
> 
> I have to think will my rewriting history here make re-review harder? [...] This is a textbook example of tooling deficiencies dictating a sub-optimal workflow and outcome: because pull requests don't track commits explicitly, I'm forced to adopt a non-ideal workflow or sacrifice something like commit quality in order to minimize risks that the review tool won't get confused.

That said, ultimately, the individuals investing their efforts will have a significant say in determining the replacement. We that are concerned of GitHub pull will aceept the result, but I hope that the level of harm caused by the less-capable system is deemed acceptable. My primary worries include:

- Efficient subscription: how do contributors effectively [subscribe to patches](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56638) they are interested in?
- Review time: will we witness an increase in less prepared patches? Will they consume more time from established reviewers? Or will they be rubber stamped more frequently?
- Will we have dirty commit messages such as "Fix typo", "Add test", "Resolve XXX's comments"? We can force "Squash and merge" (forbid "Create a merge commit" and "Rebase and merge"), but it is difficult to ensure clean commit messages, if contributors have to think of implications of rewriting history.

### Appendix

I did a SQL query to find the numbers of accepted/rejected patches by Phabricator username between the two tags [`llvmorg-17-init`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/llvmorg-17-init) and [`llvmorg-18-init`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/llvmorg-18-init) (181 days), which roughly corresponds to the LLVM 17.x release cycle.

```sql
select u.username, count(distinct r.lastActionDIffPHID) from differential_reviewer r join phabricator_user.user u where r.reviewerStatus in ('accepted','rejected') and 1674629847<=r.dateCreated and r.dateCreated<1674634847 and r.reviewerPHID=u.phid group by r.reviewerPHID;
```
