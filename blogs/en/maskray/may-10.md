# Fighting Hyrum's Law in LLVM

> _With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody._ — Hyrum's Law

In a compiler, the most common form of Hyrum's Law is dependence on _unspecified behavior_ — hash bucket order, the order of equal elements after `std::sort`, padding offsets. The same framing covers a few cases that are technically undefined behavior (use of an invalidated iterator) or plain incidental properties (ABI struct layout, ELF section offsets).

When the compiler itself harbors such a dependency, the symptom is usually output that varies build-to-build: an unstable sort that lands differently after the standard library changes, a hash map whose iteration order shifts when the hash function does. Occasionally the variation is run-to-run within a single build — `DenseMap<void *, X>` keys with an ASLR-derived seed reorder buckets each invocation. Either way, reproducible builds, bisection, and bug reports all assume same input → same output, and a stealth Hyrum dependency breaks that.

This post surveys some mechanisms that perturb the contract's blind spots so dependencies cannot quietly form.

## Hash seed perturbation

The first line of defense is the hash function itself. `llvm/include/llvm/ADT/Hashing.h`:

```cpp
inline uint64_t get_execution_seed() {
#if LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS
  return static_cast<uint64_t>(
      reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(&install_fatal_error_handler));
#else
  return 0xff51afd7ed558ccdULL;
#endif
}
```

The seed XORed into every `llvm::hash_value` is the runtime address of `install_fatal_error_handler` — under ASLR, different every process. The header comment is explicit:

> _the seed is non-deterministic per process (address of a function in LLVMSupport) to prevent having users depend on the particular hash values._

Every `hash_combine` / `hash_integer_value` call picks up the seed, and every `DenseMap<K, V>` keyed by a `hash_value`-using type then reorders its buckets per run. MD5, BLAKE3, SHA1, SHA256 stay byte-stable — those are the right tools when you actually want a digest.

My [commit `ce80c80dca45`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/ce80c80dca45) introduced the seed in 2024.

## Container iteration order

Code can grow dependencies on the iteration order. `LLVM_ENABLE_REVERSE_ITERATION` walks hash containers backwards to flag violations. `llvm/include/llvm/Support/ReverseIteration.h`:

```cpp
template <class T = void *> constexpr bool shouldReverseIterate() {
#if LLVM_ENABLE_REVERSE_ITERATION
  return detail::IsPointerLike<T>::value;
#else
  return false;
#endif
}
```

`DenseMap` flips its `BucketItTy` to `std::reverse_iterator<pointer>`; `SmallPtrSet` swaps `begin()` and `end()`; `StringMap` bitwise-NOTs the hash before bucket selection — the only thing that perturbs `StringMap`, since its hash bypasses `get_execution_seed`.

Unlike the hash seed, reverse iteration isn't auto-on with assertions; `-DLLVM_REVERSE_ITERATION=ON` opts in explicitly. In 2026 has already merged fixes triggered by it: [`7f703cabf728`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7f703cabf728) (MLIR SSA-value completion order), [`0b3afd35c41d`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/0b3afd35c41d) (MLIR SROA alloca order), and [`f5e2c5ddcec7`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/f5e2c5ddcec7) (a clang test).

## Iterator invalidation

Orthogonal to iteration order: what happens to an existing iterator after a mutation. `llvm/include/llvm/ADT/EpochTracker.h`:

```cpp
class DebugEpochBase {
  uint64_t Epoch = 0;
public:
  void incrementEpoch() { ++Epoch; }
  ~DebugEpochBase() { incrementEpoch(); }  // catches use-after-free

  class HandleBase {
    bool isHandleInSync() const {
      return *EpochAddress == EpochAtCreation;
    }
  };
};
```

`DenseMap` and friends inherit from `DebugEpochBase`. Mutations bump the epoch; iterators capture it at construction and assert on mismatch. The destructor bumps too, so stale iterators into destroyed containers assert rather than read freed memory.

Without it, mutate-during-iteration "happens to work" depending on bucket layout — and bucket layout is what the hash seed and reverse iteration above perturb. The epoch check turns the latent bug into a clean assert regardless of which "lucky" layout the run lands on. Collapses to a no-op under `NDEBUG`.

## Pre-shuffling unstable sorts

The same defensive pattern shows up twice in the monorepo, in different sub-projects, years apart.

### `llvm::sort` under `EXPENSIVE_CHECKS`

`llvm/include/llvm/ADT/STLExtras.h`:

```cpp
#ifdef EXPENSIVE_CHECKS
namespace detail {
inline unsigned presortShuffleEntropy() {
  static unsigned Result(std::random_device{}());
  return Result;
}

template <class IteratorTy>
inline void presortShuffle(IteratorTy Start, IteratorTy End) {
  std::mt19937 Generator(presortShuffleEntropy());
  llvm::shuffle(Start, End, Generator);
}
} // end namespace detail
#endif

template <typename IteratorTy, typename Compare>
inline void sort(IteratorTy Start, IteratorTy End, Compare Comp) {
#ifdef EXPENSIVE_CHECKS
  detail::presortShuffle<IteratorTy>(Start, End);
#endif
  std::sort(Start, End, Comp);
}
```

`std::sort` and `qsort` are unstable; code observing the order of equal elements is depending on undocumented behavior. Pre-shuffling makes that observation different every run. [commit `5a3d47fabcb6`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/5a3d47fabcb6) added the wrapper in 2018, motivated by [PR35135](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35135).

LLVM also ships its own `llvm::shuffle` rather than calling `std::shuffle`, "so that LLVM behaves the same when using different standard libraries." A reproducibility tool whose reproducibility depends on the host stdlib is worse than no tool — and the linker section below relies on this.

`llvm::stable_sort` deliberately does not pre-shuffle; it is the explicit opt-in for code that legitimately needs ordering of equal elements.

### libc++ `_LIBCPP_DEBUG_RANDOMIZE_UNSPECIFIED_STABILITY`

libc++ has a near-perfect parallel mechanism, designed for downstream users rather than the project's own internals. `libcxx/include/__debug_utils/randomize_range.h`:

```cpp
template <class _AlgPolicy, class _Iterator, class _Sentinel>
_LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX14
void __debug_randomize_range(_Iterator __first, _Sentinel __last) {
#ifdef _LIBCPP_DEBUG_RANDOMIZE_UNSPECIFIED_STABILITY
  if (!__libcpp_is_constant_evaluated())
    std::__shuffle<_AlgPolicy>(__first, __last, __libcpp_debug_randomizer());
#else
  (void)__first; (void)__last;
#endif
}
```

Three callsites:

- — pre-shuffles the input.
- — pre-shuffles the input

  re-shuffles the unsorted tail afterward.
- — pre-shuffles, then re-shuffles each side of the partition.

Seed handling rhymes with `get_execution_seed`: ASLR or static `std::random_device` for per-process variation, with `_LIBCPP_RANDOMIZE_UNSPECIFIED_STABILITY_SEED=<n>` as a fixed-seed escape hatch. Off by default; C++11 and later only.

`libcxx/docs/DesignDocs/UnspecifiedBehaviorRandomization.rst` explains the motivation:

> _Google has measured couple of thousands of tests to be dependent on the stability of sorting and selection algorithms. As we also plan on updating (or least, providing under flag more) sorting algorithms, this effort helps doing it gradually and sustainably._

It cites [PR20837](https://llvm.org/PR20837) — a worst-case `O(n²)` `std::sort` — as the upgrade libc++ specifically wanted to ship. The shuffle is the gating tool: if downstream tests pass with it enabled, they will pass after the algorithm change too.

Comparing the two is more interesting than either alone:

- 's wrapper is internal hygiene: LLVM is its own primary user, so the shuffle lives in

  behind a build flag with no docs.
- page, public macro, public seed override, explicit "Patches welcome." invitation. It has to be: libc++'s users are not libc++, and the contract being defended is the C++ standard itself.
- applies at three callsites, each declaring which sub-range the algorithm leaves unspecified. LLVM's wrapper only covers the simpler equal-element case.
- iteration order — are unspecified in both, but libc++ does not randomize them. LLVM-the-library does; on this one surface LLVM is ahead of its own stdlib.

## Linker output: `--shuffle-sections` and `--randomize-section-padding`

Two ELF-only lld knobs perturb layout details that no contract covers.

### `--shuffle-sections=<glob>=<seed>`

`lld/ELF/Writer.cpp`:

```cpp
for (const auto &patAndSeed : ctx.arg.shuffleSections) {
  ...
  const uint32_t seed = patAndSeed.second;
  if (seed == UINT32_MAX) {
    // If --shuffle-sections <section-glob>=-1, reverse the section order.
    // The section order is stable even if the number of sections changes.
    // This is useful to catch issues like static initialization order
    // fiasco reliably.
    std::reverse(matched.begin(), matched.end());
  } else {
    std::mt19937 g(seed ? seed : std::random_device()());
    llvm::shuffle(matched.begin(), matched.end(), g);
  }
}
```

Three regimes in one option:

- — deterministic reverse, stable even as new sections appear. Glob

  to

  , rebuild, run the test suite: anything that breaks is a real static-init-order bug. One flag, no Frankenstein link script.
- — deterministic random shuffle, reproducible across runs and hosts (because

  is host-independent). Useful in CI without breaking bisection.
- —

  -seeded. Fresh nondeterminism every link.

History: [`423cb321dfae`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/423cb321dfae) introduced the `=-1` reverse mode; [`16c30c3c23ef`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/16c30c3c23ef) generalized to per-glob seeds, which is what makes the `.init_array*=-1` recipe possible; [`c135a68d426f`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c135a68d426f) fixed a bug where the feature itself produced an invalid dynamic relocation order — even Hyrum mitigations have correctness traps.

### `--randomize-section-padding=<seed>`

The sister option perturbs section _offsets_ by inserting padding between input sections and at segment starts (`lld/ELF/Writer.cpp`):

```cpp
static void randomizeSectionPadding(Ctx &ctx) {
  std::mt19937 g(*ctx.arg.randomizeSectionPadding);
  // Insert padding between input sections and at segment starts.
}
```

Callers grow dependencies on padding-induced offsets the linker never promised — profile-guided pipelines, side-channel research, exploit toolchains pinning to specific addresses. A seeded perturbation makes those dependencies visible.

Both options are ELF-only; MachO and COFF ports have nothing equivalent.

## ABI break detection

`llvm/include/llvm/Config/abi-breaking.h.cmake`:

```c
#if LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS
ABI_BREAKING_EXPORT_ABI extern int EnableABIBreakingChecks;
LLVM_HIDDEN_VISIBILITY
__attribute__((weak)) int *VerifyEnableABIBreakingChecks =
    &EnableABIBreakingChecks;
#else
ABI_BREAKING_EXPORT_ABI extern int DisableABIBreakingChecks;
...
#endif
```

Every TU including the header takes a weak reference to `EnableABIBreakingChecks` or `DisableABIBreakingChecks` depending on its own build flag. Mixing the two against the same `libLLVM` produces an unresolved symbol at link time. MSVC gets the same guarantee via `#pragma detect_mismatch`.

Out-of-tree users routinely compile against headers from one tree and link against a different `libLLVM`. Without this gate, whichever struct layout the link happens to pick silently miscompiles; with it, the link fails.

## What LLVM is _not_ doing

The mechanisms above all target surfaces no stable consumer should care about: bucket order, equal-element sort order, init-array order. Debuggers, profilers, sanitizers, and reproducible-build infrastructure consume those outputs and need them stable.

In some cases, stronger guarantee is only provided with explicit options. For example, Bitcode and textual IR preserve use-list order only under `-preserve-bc-uselistorder` / `-preserve-ll-uselistorder`.

A near-cousin: clang's `-frandomize-layout-seed` / `__attribute__((randomize_layout))`. Mechanically the same — seeded `std::shuffle` on struct fields — and it does coincidentally invalidate `offsetof` dependencies. But the intent is exploit mitigation, cribbed from GrSecurity's Randstruct GCC plugin: per-build kernel hardening, not a developer tool.
