# All about COMMON symbols

## Programming language behavior

FORTRAN 77 COMMON blocks compiled to COMMON symbols. You could declare a COMMON block in more than one file, with each specifying the number, type, and size of the variable. The linker allocated enough space to satisfy the largest size.

This feature was somehow ported to C. Unix C compilers traditionally permitted a variable using tentative definition in different compilation units and the linker would allocate enough space without reporting an error.

This behavior is constrast to both C and C++ standards, but GCC and Clang traditionally defaulted to `-fcommon` for C. GCC since [10](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html) and Clang since [11](https://releases.llvm.org/11.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) default to `-fno-common`.

```c
% echo 'int x;' > a.c
% gcc -S -fcommon a.c -o - | grep -w x
        .comm   x,4,4
% gcc -S -fno-common a.c -o - | grep -w x
        .globl  x
        .type   x, @object
        .size   x, 4
x:
```

## Assembler behavior

The directive `.comm identifier, size[, alignment]` instructs the assembler to define a COMMON symbol with the specified size and the optional alignment.

In the ELF object file format, the symbol is represented as a `STT_OBJECT` `STB_GLOBAL` symbol whose `st_shndx` field holds `SHN_COMMON`. In readelf, the `SHN_COMMON` value is shown as `COM`.

```c
typedef struct {
  Elf32_Word    st_name;
  Elf32_Addr    st_value;
  Elf32_Word    st_size;
  unsigned char st_info;
  unsigned char st_other;
  Elf32_Half    st_shndx;
} Elf32_Sym;

typedef struct {
  Elf64_Word    st_name;
  unsigned char st_info;
  unsigned char st_other;
  Elf64_Half    st_shndx;
  Elf64_Addr    st_value;
  Elf64_Xword   st_size;
} Elf64_Sym;
```

The `st_value` field holds the alignment. This is an interesting abuse. Regular definitions are relative to a section (`st_value` is a section offset) and the section alignment (`sh_addralign`) is sufficient to encode the symbol alignment information. For COMMON symbols, the section information is unavailable but fortunately `st_value` is vacant.

```sh
% cat a.s
.comm x,8,4  # size=8, alignment=4
% as a.s -o a.o
% readelf -Ws a.o

Symbol table '.symtab' contains 2 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND
     1: 0000000000000004     8 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  COM x
```

The binding `STB_WEAK` is not allowed. Other types are not allowed: 1

% as err.s

The generic ABI supports `STT_COMMON` as another way to label a COMMON symbol. It says:

> Symbols with type `STT_COMMON` label uninitialized common blocks. In relocatable objects, these symbols are not allocated and must have the special section index `SHN_COMMON` (see below). In shared objects and executables these symbols must be allocated to some section in the defining object.
> 
> In relocatable objects, symbols with type `STT_COMMON` are treated just as other symbols with index `SHN_COMMON`. If the link-editor allocates space for the `SHN_COMMON` symbol in an output section of the object it is producing, it must preserve the type of the output symbol as `STT_COMMON`.
> 
> When the dynamic linker encounters a reference to a symbol that resolves to a definition of type `STT_COMMON`, it may (but is not required to) change its symbol resolution rules as follows: instead of binding the reference to the first symbol found with the given name, the dynamic linker searches for the first symbol with that name with type other than `STT_COMMON`. If no such symbol is found, it looks for the `STT_COMMON` definition of that name that has the largest size.

`--elf-stt-common=yes` causes GNU assembler to use `STT_COMMON`. It is super rare in the wild, though. 1

## Linker behavior

### Symbol resolution

The key is: a COMMON symbol does not lead to a duplicate definition error with any kind of definitions. 1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
6  
# Two STB_GLOBAL definitions lead to a duplicate definition error.  
% as -o b.o \<\<\< '.data; .globl x; x:'  
% ld.lld -e 0 b.o b.o  
ld.lld: error: duplicate symbol: x  
\>\>\> defined at b.o:(.data+0x0)  
\>\>\> defined at b.o:(.data+0x0)

However, the size and alignment fields may be updated when two COMMON symbols are merged. The quoted generic ABI text describes the behavior when a COMMON symbol has different sizes in relocatable objects. The output symbol gets the largest size.

Platforms differ in how the alignment is selected. GNU ld and ld.lld pick the largest alignment. 1  
2  
3  
as -o a.o \<\<\< '.comm x,8,4'  
as -o b.o \<\<\< '.comm x,4,8'  
ld a.o b.o # st_size==8, aligned by 8

Mach-O ld64 lets the copy with the largest size decide the alignment.

In ELF, for a definition in a relocatable object file, the precedence is `STB_GLOBAL > COMMON > STB_WEAK`.

> When the link editor combines several relocatable object files, it does not allow multiple definitions of `STB_GLOBAL` symbols with the same name. On the other hand, if a defined global symbol exists, the appearance of a weak symbol with the same name will not cause an error. The link editor honors the global definition and ignores the weak ones. Similarly, if a common symbol exists (that is, a symbol whose `st_shndx` field holds `SHN_COMMON`), the appearance of a weak symbol with the same name will not cause an error. The link editor honors the common definition and ignores the weak ones.

```sh
as -o a.o <<< '.comm x,8,4'
as -o b.o <<< '.data; .globl x; x: .space 16; .size x, 16'
as -o c.o <<< '.data; .weak x; x: .space 16; .size x, 16'
```

```sh
% ld.bfd -e 0 a.o b.o  # b.o wins (COMMON < STB_GLOBAL)
ld.bfd: warning: alignment 1 of symbol `x' in b.o is smaller than 4 in a.o
ld.bfd: warning: size of symbol `x' changed from 8 in a.o to 16 in b.o
% ld.bfd -e 0 a.o c.o  # a.o wins (COMMON > STB_WEAK)
```

When a common symbol is merged with a dynamic symbol, GNU ld displays different behaviors depending on whether the dynamic symbol is relative to a BSS section. See the definition of `newdyncommon` in `bfd/elflink.c:_bfd_elf_merge_symbol` (originally `bfd/elflink.h` from "19990502 sourceware import"). 1

as -o a.o \<\<\< '.comm x,8,4'  
as -o bss.o \<\<\< '.bss; .globl x; x: .quad 0; .size x, .-x' && ld -shared bss.o -o bss.so  
as -o data.o \<\<\< '.data; .globl x; x: .quad 0; .size x, .-x' && ld -shared data.o -o data.so  
ld.bfd a.o bss.so -o bfd.bss # x is defined  
ld.bfd a.o data.so -o bfd.data # x is undefined  
ld.lld a.o bss.so -o lld.bss # x is defined  
ld.lld a.o data.so -o lld.data # x is defined

This special case does not make sense to me. In a relocatable object file, a COMMON symbol is stronger than a weak symbol. Since a weak symbol takes precedence over a dynamic symbol, a COMMON symbol should as well. gold and ld.lld unconditionally let the common symbol win.

When a common symbol is merged with a dynamic symbol, GNU ld and ld.lld (see [D71161](https://reviews.llvm.org/D71161)) increase `st_size` if the shared symbol has a larger `st_size`. 1  
2  
3  
4  
as -o a.o \<\<\< '.comm x,8,4'  
as -o b.o \<\<\< '.comm x,4,8'  
ld -shared a.o -o a.so  
ld a.so b.o # st_size==8, aligned by 4

GNU ld ported a strange rule from SUN's linker in 1999-12: [GNU-ld behaviour does not match native linker behaviour](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/1999-December/002952.html).

When a COMMON symbol in relocatable object files has a larger size than that of the shared object, if we allocate the COMMON symbol in the executable, with the help of symbol interposition, both accesses from the executable and the shared object will be bound to the larger object. On the other hand, if we leave the symbol undefined in the executable, the accesses from the executable may go out-of-bounds.

> Here is a table showing when an element is pulled in from an archive with the Solaris 2.6 linker and ar program:

```text
main program\archive   undefined    common    defined

undefined                no          yes       yes
common                   no          no        yes
defined                  no          no        no
```

When a symbol is COMMON and ld sees an archive, ld checks whether the archive index provides a `STB_GLOBAL` definition of the symbol. If yes, ld extracts the archive as well. This is in contrary to the usual rule that only an undefined symbol leads to archive member extraction.

ld.lld since 12.0.0 has this behavior ([D86142](https://reviews.llvm.org/D86142)) with the enabled-by-default `--fortran-common` option.

Say `b0.a` and `b1.a` are mostly identical archives, but `b0.a` objects are compiled with `-fcommon` while `b1.a` objects are compiled with `-fno-common` . If `a.o` references `b0.a`, this archive lookup behavior may cause a duplicate definition error for `ld a.o b0.a b1.a` while `b1.a` can be shadowed by `b0.a` without the rule.

```sh
echo 'extern int ret; int main() { return ret; }' > a.c
echo 'int ret; void foo() {}' > b.c
gcc -c a.c
gcc -c -fcommon b.c -o b0.o && rm -f b0.a && ar rc b0.a b0.o
gcc -c b.c -o b1.o && rm -f b1.a && ar rc b1.a b1.o
```

```text
# ret in b0.a(b0.o) is COMMON. b1.a(b1.o) is extracted to override the COMMON symbol with a STB_GLOBAL definition.
% gcc a.o b0.a b1.a
ld.lld: error: duplicate symbol: foo
>>> defined at b.c
>>>            b0.o:(foo) in archive b0.a
>>> defined at b.c
>>>            b1.o:(.text+0x0) in archive b1.a
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
% gcc a.o b1.a b0.a  # b1.a shadows b0.a
```

What I am most concerned with is how to parallelize symbol resolution in the presence of this archive lookup rule.

GNU ld and ld.lld treat COMMON symbols as though they are in an input section named `COMMON`. `*(COMMON)` in a linker script can match these symbols.

### Error-prone COMMON symbols

With `-fcommon`, due to the linker symbol resolution rule, a tentative definition `int x;` may be overridden by a `STB_GLOBAL` definition in another compilation unit. This is error-prone since the user may assume an initial value of zero if unware of `int x = 1;`.

```sh
gcc -c -fcommon -xc - -o a.o <<< 'int x;'
gcc -c -xc - -o b.o <<< 'int x = 1;'
gcc -shared a.o b.o  # no diagnostic
```

GNU ld and ld.lld support `--warn-common` which detects the error-prone overridding. 1  
2  
% gcc -shared -fuse-ld=bfd -Wl,--warn-common a.o b.o  
/usr/bin/ld.bfd: b.o: warning: definition of `x' overriding common from a.o

Some legacy code may inadvertently rely on COMMON symbols by having something like `int x;` in a header file. Such code may not compile with `-fno-common`.

### `.bss` allocation

When producing an executable or shared object, the linker allocates space in `.bss` to hold COMMON symbols. In GNU ld, COMMON symbols are placed after `.bss` and `.bss.*` input sections.

```text
.bss            :
{
 *(.dynbss)
 *(.bss .bss.* .gnu.linkonce.b.*)
 *(COMMON)
 /* Align here to ensure that the .bss section occupies space up to
    _end.  Align after .bss to ensure correct alignment even if the
    .bss section disappears because there are no input sections.
    FIXME: Why do we need it? When there is no .bss section, we do not
    pad the .data section.  */
 . = ALIGN(. != 0 ? 64 / 8 : 1);
}
```

In a relocatable link, COMMON symbols remain COMMON.

## Run-time behavior

```c
// a.c
#include <stdio.h>
int x;
void foo();
int main() {
  foo();
  printf("%d\n", x);
}

// b.c
int x;
void foo() { x++; }
```

When `a.c` and `b.c` are in the same component (main executable or shared object), with `-fcommon`, it's clear that the two `x` resolves to the same copy and the output is 1. 1  
2  
% gcc -fcommon a.c b.c && ./a.out  
1

If `b.c` is compiled and linked into a different component, this works with the help of ELF symbol interposition. When linking the shared object, `x` is preemptible (default visibility non-local binding) and its access requires GOT indirection. When linking the executable, the linker exports `x` to the dynamic symbol table because it is used by an input shared object. 1

 5: 00000000000037a0 4 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 20 x

If you make `x` non-preemptible (e.g. vi `-Bsymbolic`) in `b.so`, `b.so` will get its own copy. 1

#### `--no-define-common`

In 2001-09, [optionally postpone assignment of Common](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2001-September/014015.html) added this option to be used with `-shared`.

Here is my understanding: glibc around 2.1.3 used to have a ld.so bug that the ELF interposition might not work. Using `--no-define-common` with shared objects can make COMMON symbols undefined and circumvent the bug. 1  
2  
3  
4  
% gcc -fpic -Wl,--no-define-common -shared -fuse-ld=bfd -fcommon b.c -o b.so  
% readelf -W --dyn-syms b.so | egrep 'Num:| x'  
 Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name  
 1: 0000000000000000 0 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT UND x

gold [confuses `--define-common` with `-d`/`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=0dfbdef4c43cfe12bb3e2505ebe5acc651a35c98) and implements `--define-common` with `-d` semantics. Its `--no-define-common` is incompatible with GNU ld.

#### `-d`, `-dc`, `-dp`

In a relocatable link, a COMMON symbol remains COMMON in the output. If `-dc` is specified, the linker will allocate space to COMMON symbols. `-d` and `-dp` are aliases for `-dc`.

```text
% gcc -fpic -fcommon -r -fuse-ld=bfd b.c -o b.ro && readelf -Ws b.ro | egrep 'Num:| x'
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     9: 0000000000000004     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  COM x
% gcc -fpic -fcommon -r -fuse-ld=bfd -Wl,-dc b.c -o b.ro && readelf -Ws b.ro | egrep 'Num:| x'
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     9: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    7 x
```

The output has a regular `STB_GLOBAL` definition. Linking the relocatable output with another which defines `x` will lead to a duplicate definition error. 1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
ld.bfd -r b.o -o b.ro  
ld.bfd b.ro b.ro # ok. COMMON symbols are merged  
  
ld.bfd -r -dc b.o -o b.ro  
ld.bfd b.ro b.ro # duplicate definition error

The options are obscure and might be used to work around some legacy programs. If the relocatable output is fed into the linker again, ignoring `-dc` should usually work as well. Only when the program inspects relocatable output by itself and does not recognize COMMON symbols, there may be a problem. This implies that the program cannot process a relocatable object with COMMON symbols produced by the assembler.

For ld.lld, I removed `-dp` and ignored `-d`/`-dc` for 15.0.0: [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53660](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53660).

#### `--sort-common`

By sorting COMMON symbols by decreasing alignment, some padding can be saved. However, I think this hardly ever has any size benefit. For example, musl specifies `--sort-common` by default. With `-fcommon`, I see a 24 byte decrease of `.bss`. The total size of `.bss` is 11344 bytes.

 Discarded input sections
```

Actually, this can degrade performance if COMMON symbols in an object file have locality and `--sort-common` breaks the locality.

### `edata`, `end`, and `etext`

For legacy reasons GNU ld's internal linker script has `PROVIDE(edata = .);` and similar symbol assignments for the other two symbols. In GNU ld, the definition precedence is: regular symbol assignment \> relocatable object definition \> `PROVIDE` symbol assignment.

If a relocatable object file defines `end`, it will take precedence over the internal linker script `PROVIDE(end = .);`. This makes sense because the global variable `int end;` is valid in C and C++.

Before ld.lld 15, `int end;` compiled with `-fcommon` is overridden by the linker definition. This will be fixed by [D120389](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120389).

## LLVM IR

In LLVM IR, a COMMON symbol has the ["common" linkage](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#linkage-types). It is an interposable linkage and some optimizations are suppressed. For example:

- InstCombine assumes that the addresses of a `common global i8` and an `external global i32` may be the same.
- `llvm.objectsize` intrinsic does not know the size. This may lead to conservative assumptions for some `_chk` functions.

## Processor-specific COMMON symbols

### AMDGPU LDS symbols

In LLVM, the AMDGPU target uses the address space 3 to indicate the hardware Local Data Store (LDS), which is automatically allocated when the hardware creates the wavefronts of a work-group, and freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. 1  
LOCAL_ADDRESS = 3, ///\< Address space for local memory.

Variables in this address space lower to a special COMMON symbol with the section index `SHN_AMDGPU_LDS` instead of `SHN_COMMON`. ([https://reviews.llvm.org/D61493](https://reviews.llvm.org/D61493)) The assembly syntax is `.amdgpu_lds sym,size,align`.

In 2019, the [assembler implementation](https://reviews.llvm.org/D61493) inappropriately introduced a new symbol kind, `SymContentsTargetCommon`, which has been [removed](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/aa96e20dcefa7d73229c98a7d2727696ff949459) by me.

### Hexagon COMMON symbols

[Qualcomm Hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon) uses distinct section indexes for small-sized COMMON symbols. These symbols are allocated to small BSS sections and are accessed using a global pointer. Qualcomm's [eld linker](https://github.com/qualcomm/eld), open-sourced in 2025, uses these section indexes.

- `SHN_HEXAGON_SCOMMON_1`
- `SHN_HEXAGON_SCOMMON_2`
- `SHN_HEXAGON_SCOMMON_4`
- `SHN_HEXAGON_SCOMMON_8`

This design choice seems redundant as the linker could just use the symbol's `st_size` member to determine which small BSS section to place it in.

### x86-64 large COMMON symbols

In 2005, binutils introduced `SHN_X86_64_LCOMMON` for x86-64's large code model. This x86-64-specific feature adds architectural divergence to what is essentially a legacy mechanism. Notably, `SHN_X86_64_LCOMMON` isn't even defined in glibc's elf.h.

The processor-specific section index range `SHN_LOPROC~SHN_HIPROC` exists but remains unused across Linux linkers and binary utilities. Supporting `SHN_X86_64_LCOMMON` alone would introduce unwanted overhead in performance-critical linker code paths.

Modern alternatives eliminate the need for COMMON blocks:

- Modules approach: Define variables in a single module source file and compile once (recommended practice in modern Fortran)
- COMDAT sections: For linker behavior where duplicate symbols don't error, place symbols in `.lbss` using COMDAT section groups

I [recommend using COMDAT as a replacement](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/161483):

```plaintext
.section .lbss.foo,"awG",%nobits,foo,comdat
.globl foo
.space 8
.size foo, 8
```

## `.lcomm` directive

`.lcomm sym,size` provides a concise way to define a local symbol in the `.bss` section. The defined symbol is _not_ a COMMON symbol.

## WebAssembly does not support COMMON symbols

[A proposed LLVM workaround patch](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/151478) aimed to implement COMMON symbols using weak symbols, but I rejected it for the following reasons:

- The fundamental requirement of COMMON symbols-where the linker allocates space to accommodate the largest symbol size-cannot be emulated using weak symbols.
- Introducing another method for generating weak symbols could lead to confusion.

For use cases where the "largest size" property is not needed, a COMDAT section group offers a viable alternative to achieve similar functionality.
