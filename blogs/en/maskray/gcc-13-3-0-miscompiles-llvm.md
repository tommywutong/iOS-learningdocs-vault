# GCC 13.3.0 miscompiles LLVM

For years, I've been involved in updating LLVM's MC layer. A recent journey led me to [eliminate the `FK_PCRel_` fixup kinds](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-05-26-llvm-integrated-assembler-improving-expressions-and-relocations):

```
MCFixup: Remove FK_PCRel_

The generic FK_Data_ fixup kinds handle both absolute and PC-relative
fixups. ELFObjectWriter sets IsPCRel to true for `.long foo-.`, so the
backend has to handle PC-relative FK_Data_.

However, the existence of FK_PCRel_ encouraged backends to implement it
as a separate fixup type, leading to redundant and error-prone code.

Removing FK_PCRel_ simplifies the overall fixup mechanism.
```

As a prerequisite, I had to update several backends that relied on the now-deleted fixup kinds. It was during this process that something unexpected happened. Contributors [reported that when built by GCC 13.3.0](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c20379198c7fb66b9514d21ae1e07b0705e3e6fa), the LLVM integrated assembler had test failures.

To investigate, I downloaded and built GCC 13.3.0 locally:

```sh
../../configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/gcc-13.3.0 --disable-bootstrap --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-libsanitizer --disable-multilib
make -j 30 && make -j 30 install
```

I then built a Release build (`-O3`) of LLVM. Sure enough, the failure was reproducible:

```plaintext

```

Interestingly, a RelWithDebInfo build (`-O2 -g`) of LLVM did not reproduce the failure, suggesting either an undefined behavior, or an optimization-related issue within GCC 13.3.0.

## The Bisection trail

I built GCC at the `releases/gcc-13` branch, and the issue vanished. This strongly indicated that the problem lay somewhere between the `releases/gcc-13.3.0` tag and the `releases/gcc-13` branch.

The bisection led me to a specific commit, directing me to [https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109934#c6](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109934#c6).

I developed a workaround at the code block with a typo "RemaningOps". Although I had observed it before, I was hesitant to introduce a commit solely for a typo fix. However, it became clear this was the perfect opportunity to address both the typo and implement a workaround for the GCC miscompilation. This led to the landing of [this commit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/6d67794d164ebeedbd287816e1541964fb5d6c99), resolving the miscompilation.

Sam James from Gentoo mentioned that the miscompilation was introduced by a commit cherry-picked into GCC 13.3.0. GCC 13.2.0 and GCC 13.4.0 are good.
