# Assemblers

Updated in 2025-05.

This article provides a description of popular assemblers and their architecture-specific differences.

## Assemblers

GCC generates assembly code and invokes GNU Assembler (also known as "gas"), which is part of GNU Binutils, to convert the assembly code into machine code. The GCC driver is also capable of accepting assembly input files. Due to GCC's widespread use, GNU Assembler is arguably the most popular assembler.

Within the LLVM project, the LLVM integrated assembler is a library that is linked by Clang, llvm-mc, and lld (for LTO purposes) to generate machine code. It supports a wide range of GNU Assembler syntax and can be used as a drop-in replacement for GNU Assembler.

On the Windows platform, the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is widely used.

On the IBM AIX platform, the AIX assembler is used. In 2019, IBM developers started to modify LLVM integrated assembler to support the AIX syntax.

On the IBM z/OS platform, the IBM High Level Assembler (HLASM) is used. In 2021, IBM developers started to modify LLVM integrated assembler to support the HLASM syntax.

## Concepts

Sections are named, contiguous blocks of code or data within an object file. They allow you to logically group related parts of your program. The assembler places code and data into these sections as it processes the source file.

Symbols are names that represent memory addresses or values.

## Instruction set architectures

### x86

There are two main syntax dialects: the Microsoft assembler (MASM) syntax and the GNU assembler (GAS) syntax. The MASM syntax is also known as the Intel syntax, widely utilized in the Windows environment and within the reverse engineering community. The GNU syntax, also known as the AT&T syntax, derived from PDP-11, is default and dominant in the *NIX world. The GNU syntax exhibits several key differences:

- The operand list is reversed compared to Intel syntax.
- The four-part generic addressing mode is written as `displacement(base,index,scale)` instead of `[base+index*scale+disp]` in Intel syntax.
- Immediate values are prefixed with `$`, while registers are prefixed with `%`.
- The mnemonics have a suffix indicating the operand size, e.g. `b` for 1 byte, `w` for 2 bytes (Word), `d` for 4 bytes (Dword), and `q` for 8 bytes (Qword).

```plaintext
% gcc -S a.c
% cat a.s
...
        movl    var(%rip), %eax
        addl    $3, %eax
% gcc -S -masm=intel a.c
% cat a.s
...
        .intel_syntax noprefix
...
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR var[rip]
        add     eax, 3
```

Using `as -msyntax=intel -mnaked-reg` allows parsing the input in the Intel syntax without a register prefix. This is similar to including a `.intel_syntax noprefix` directive in the input.

With `llvm-mc -x86-asm-syntax=intel`, the input can be parsed in the Intel syntax. Using `-output-asm-variant=1` will print instructions in Intel syntax.

`llvm-mc -output-asm-variant=1` and [`clang -Xclang --output-asm-variant=1`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/109360) can be used to select the syntax for output.

However, the Intel syntax has not been formally defined, and causes ambiguity for symbol references. Many x86 instructions take an operand that can be a register or a memory location. Due to the ambiguity, variable names that collide with registers cannot be used with GCC ([https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53929](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53929)).

```plaintext
% cat ambiguous.c
int *rip, rax;
int foo() { return rip[rax]; }
% gcc -S -masm=intel ambiguous.c -o -
...
        mov     rax, QWORD PTR rip[rip]
        mov     edx, DWORD PTR rax[rip]
% gcc -c -masm=intel ambiguous.c
/tmp/ccEOMwm6.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccEOMwm6.s:28: Error: invalid use of register
/tmp/ccEOMwm6.s:29: Error: invalid use of register
```

The `_` or `@` prefix in 32-bit Windows's symbol names may be used for disambiguation.

I wish that `-masm=intel` will become the default. ([Please, really, make `-masm=intel` the default for x86](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc/2022-November/240103.html).

For x86 architecture, NASM and YASM are also popular assemblers. They uses a variant of Intel syntax that omits `PTR` in constructs like `DWORD PTR`.

---

gas's x86 port supports `-O/-O2/-Os` options to [encode instructions using alternative, shorter or more efficient forms](https://sourceware.org/PR22871). For example, most instructions need a REX prefix to encode REX.W if the operand size is 64-bit. Sometimes the 32-bit operand size is sufficient and the conversion is beneficial due to shorter sizes without affecting CPU's store forwarding, e.g. `andq $imm31, %reg; xorq %reg, %reg -> andl $imm31, %reg; xorl %reg, %reg`. AND/OR instructions using the same register can be converted to TEST, e.g. `andq %reg, %reg -> testq %reg, %reg`.

For x86 architecture, NASM is another popular assembler.

## MIPS

Specifiers are utilized to describe different access types of a symbol. This serves as a bonus as it prevents symbol references from being mistaken as register names. However, the function call-like syntax can appear verbose.

```plaintext
lui     a0, %tprel_hi(tls)
add     a0, a0, tp, %tprel_add(tls)
lw      a0, %tprel_lo(tls)(a0)
lui     a1, %hi(var)
lw      a2, %lo(var)(a1)
```

### Power ISA

Power ISA assembly may seem unusual, as general-purpose registers are not prefixed with the `r` prefix. Whether an integer denotes a register or an immediate value depends on its position as an operand in an instruction. I find that this difference slightly affects readability.

Similar to x86, postfix modifiers are used to describe different access kinds of a symbol.

```plaintext
addis 5, 13, tls@tprel@ha
lwz 5, tls@tprel@l(5)
addis 3, 2, var@toc@ha
addi 2, 2, var@toc@l
```

### AArch64

Prefix specifier are used to describe various access types of a symbol. Personally, this is the specifier syntax that I prefer the most.

```plaintext
add     x8, x8, :tprel_hi12:tls
add     x8, x8, :tprel_lo12_nc:tls
adrp    x8, fp
ldr     x8, [x8, :lo12:fp]
```

In LLVM, the `VariantKind` information is incoded as `AArch64MCExpr` (derived from `MCTargetExpr`), different from most other targets. 1  
2  
3  
4  
// llvm/lib/Target/AArch64/AArch64MCInstLower.cpp  
 Expr = AArch64MCExpr::create(Expr, RefKind, Ctx);  
// llvm/lib/Target/AArch64/AsmParser/AArch64AsmParser.cpp  
ImmVal = AArch64MCExpr::create(ImmVal, RefKind, getContext());

### RISC-V

The specifier syntax is copied from MIPS.

The documentation is available on [https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md).

## Interaction with compiler drivers

By default, Clang employs the LLVM integrated assembler for most targets. However, we can opt for using an external assembler by specifying `-fno-integrated-as`.

We can instruct GCC to pass assembler options to gas using `-Wa,`. For example, `gcc -c -Wa,-L a.c` passes the `-L` option to gas.

However, it is important to note that Clang has limited support for `-Wa,` options when the LLVM integrated assembler is used. This turns out to be fine as many `-Wa,` options aren't really needed.

## Inline assembly

Certain compilers allow the inclusion of assembly code within a high-level language.

The most widely used implementation is GCC [Basic Asm](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Basic-Asm.html) and [Extended Asm](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html). On Windows, MSVC supports [inline assembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/inline/inline-assembler) for x86-32 but not for x86-64 and Arm.

Clang supports both GCC and MSVC inline assembly. Clang's MSVC inline assembly can be utilized with x86-64.

Some compilers provide additional variants of inline assembly. Here are some relevant links:

- Free Pascal [https://wiki.freepascal.org/Asm](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Asm)
- D [https://dlang.org/spec/iasm.html](https://dlang.org/spec/iasm.html)
- Jai [https://jai.community/t/inline-assembly/139](https://jai.community/t/inline-assembly/139)
- Nim [https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-assembler-statement](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-assembler-statement)

Clang concatenates module-level inline assembly and emits it before functions, while GCC retains the order among functions. 1

`MCContext::diagnose` passes the diagnostic message to `MCContext::DiagHandler` (set up by `MachineModuleInfoWrapperPass::doInitialization`), which forwards the message to `LLVMContext::diagnose`, which in turn calls `ClangDiagnosticHandler::handleDiagnostics` (set by `BackendConsumer::HandleTranslationUnit`).

## Notes on GNU Assembler

In the binutils-gdb repository, `opcodes/` contains information on how to assemble and disassemble instructions, but a lot of instruction code also lives on `gas/config/tc-$arch.c`.

`//` is the universal comment marker that is available on all ports. Ports may support additional comment markers, e.g. `#`.

`gas/read.c:potable` defines directives available to all targets. `gcc/config/obj-elf.c:elf_pseudo_table` defines ELF-specific directives. An architecture can define its own directives.

### Symbol equating directives

In GNU Assembler, the following directives are called symbol equating. I have re-read its documentation [https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as.html](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as.html). Yes, it uses "equating" instead of "assignment" or "definition".

- `symbol = expression` (multiple `=` on the same symbol is allowed)
- `.set symbol, expression` (equivalent to `=`)
- `.equ symbol, expression` (equivalent to `=`)
- `.equiv symbol, expression` (redefinition leads to errors)
- `.eqv symbol, expression` (lazy evaluation, not implemented in LLVM integrated assembler)

`.equiv` equates a symbol to an expression and reports an error if the symbol was already defined.

`.set sym, expr` (synonymous with `.equ sym, expr` and `sym = expr`) equates a symbol to an expression. This can either define a symbol or redirect an undefined symbol to another symbol. The expression can use forward reference, namely symbols that are not defined yet. The defined symbols have the `STB_LOCAL` binding by default, and can be changed with `.globl` or `.weak` directive. `S_SET_VOLATILE` is called, so the defined symbol can be redefined. For a symbol equated to undefined symbol, relocations are generated against the undefined symbol (`write.c:symbol_equated_reloc_p`) 1  
2  
call copymem@plt # R_X86_64_PLT32(memcpy-4)  
copymem = memcpy

`.eqv sym, expr` calls `S_SET_FORWARD_REF` on the symbol. The evaluation (including DOT) is postponed to the use site.

For example, below we define two aliases for the symbol `_start`, where `backward` has the `STB_GLOBAL` binding. 1  
2  
3  
4  
.set forward, _start  
.globl _start; _start:  
.set backward, _start  
.globl backward

Defining a local symbol alias for a global symbol can avoid certain relocations.

### DWARF support directives

`.file` and `.loc` directives are used to create the `.debug_line` section. If `-g` is specified and none of `.file` and `.loc` is used, gas synthesizes debug information:

- `.debug_info`: `DW_TAG_compile_unit` tags
- `.debug_line`
- `.debug_ranges` or `.debug_rnglists`

`.cfi*` directives are used to create `.eh_frame` or `.debug_frame`.

### Loop directives

GNU Assembler implements "INDEFINITE REPEAT BLOCK DIRECTIVES: .IRP AND .IRPC" from MACRO-11. 1

.irp i,%rax,%rbx,%rcx  
 movq \\i, %rax  
.endr  
# =\> movq %rax, %rax; movq %rbx, %rax; movq %rcx, %rax

Before June 2024, there was no good way to implement `for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)` ([http://sourceware.org/PR31752](http://sourceware.org/PR31752)). `.irpc i,0123456789` gives just 10 iterations while `.irp i,0,1,2,3,4,5,...` is tedious and error-prone.

That said, we can define a macro that expands to a sequence of strings: `0, (0+1), ((0+1)+1), (((0+1)+1)+1), ...`

```plaintext
% cat a.s
.data
.macro iota n, i=0
.if \n-\i
.byte \i
iota \n, "(\i+1)"
.endif
.endm

iota 16
% as a.s -o a.o
% readelf -x .data a.o

Hex dump of section '.data':
  0x00000000 00010203 04050607 08090a0b 0c0d0e0f ................
```

`"(\i+1)"` creates a new expression but doesn't evaluate it. To evaluate the new expression, we can use the `%` operator in the [alternate macro mode](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Altmacro.html) available since [2004](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=caa32fe507720347f37e2d060d64a89d96928db1). 1

Hex dump of section '.data':  
 0x00000000 00010203 04050607 08090a0b 0c0d0e0f ................

gas has supported `\+` for `.macro` directives since May 2024. I ported it to LLVM integrated assembler and made `\+` available for `.rept` and `.irp`/`.irpc`. We finally have a nice for loop syntax.

### Conditional execution directives

`.if`, `.ifdef`, and `.ifndef` directives allow us to write conditional code in assembly tests without using a C preprocessor. I often use `.ifdef` to combine positive tests and negative tests in one file.

```plaintext
# RUN: llvm-mc %s | FileCheck %s
# RUN: not llvm-mc --defsym ERR=1 %s -o /dev/null 2>&1 | FileCheck %s --check-prefix=ERR

# CHECK: ...
## positive tests

.ifdef ERR
# ERR: ...
## negatives tests
.endif
```

ffmpeg uses a nice technique to append `.size` directive after the function body. 1

.macro function name align=2  
 .macro endfunc  
 .size \\name, . - \\name  
 .purgem endfunc  
 .endm  
 .text  
 .balign \\align  
 \\name:  
.endm  
  
function foo align=2  
 ret  
endfunc  
  
function bar align=2  
 ret  
endfunc

`.purgem` ensures that `endfunc` is undefined after instantiated.

The `.reloc` directive creates a relocation with the specified type, location, and addend.

GNU Assembler has [supported `.incbin`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=7e005732aa09aad97c790cab88d294aeed06eada) since 2001-07 (hey, C/C++ `#embed`). The review thread mentioned that `.incbin` had been supported by some other assemblers.

[`.weakref alias, target`](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-04-25-weak-symbol#:~:text=.weakref%20directive) creates a weak alias without directly modifying the target symbol's binding. This allows a header file in library A to optionally depend on symbols from library B.

To support RISC-V linker relaxation, `gcc/config/tc-riscv.c` starts a new fragment after a relaxable instruction.

Section fragments are allocated using a gnulib `obstack`. A `struct frag` represents a fragment that contains a fixed number of bytes (like LLVM `MCDataFragment`), followed by some unknown number of bytes determined by the fragment type and other information. The fixed part is stored in a fake flexible array member `char fr_literal[1];` within the `frag` structure.

A fixup (`struct fix`) describes a location of size 1/2/4/8 within a fragment that will be changed at write time. The location will be changed to `value(fx_addsy)-value(fx_subsy)+fx_offset`.

A symbol has a name and may be attached to a fragment (`frag != NULL`). For a local symbol (created by `local_symbol_make`, used by some `STB_LOCAL` symbols), the pointer actually refers to `struct local_symbol`, which stores the section and the value. Fr a non-local symbol, the symbol is attached to a BFD symbol (`asymbol *bsym`) and contains extra fields (`struct xsymbol *x`).

`frag_offset_fixed_p` computes the offset between two fragments.

### `debug_memory`

Setting `debug_memory` to 1 causes gas to use a smaller obstack chunk size (64 instead of 4096).

### `do_scrub_chars`

The function is called to preprocess the input. A line like `# 123 filename` will be converted to a `.linefile` directive, which will be handled by `new_logical_line_flags` to affect the logical line number.

### `write_object_file`

`chain_frchains_together` chains fragments together.

`relax_seg` iterates over fragments and tries to relax them with `relax_segment`.

`size_seg` finalizes section sizes. `cvt_frag_to_fill` is called to convert fragments with a variable-size tail to fill fragments, and generate ADD/SUB relocations for RISC-V dwarf2dbg. The pass also calls `tc_frob_section` and `obj_frob_section`. `config/obj-coff.c` defines `obj_frob_section` to round up section sizes and create auxiliary symbols.

Set `finalize_syms = 1;` (to enable `symp->flags.resolved = 1;`) and resolve symbol values (in global symbol list (`symbol_rootP`), local symbols, and `.reloc` referenced symbols).

ELF defines the `obj_frob_file_before_adjust` hook (`elf_frob_file_before_adjust`) to remove unused `.weak` symbols ([[PATCH] Emit undefined weak symbols only when used](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2002-January/016431.html)), which was to work around a limitation of very old GNU ld. The hook also removes unneeded versioned symbols.

`adjust_reloc_syms` iterates over fixups and tries changing the referenced symbol to a section symbol. For an equated symbol (`symbol_equated_reloc_p`) or weak alias created by `.weakref`, the expression will be used. `config/tc-i386.c` defines `tc_fix_adjustable` to 0 to prevent section symbol conversion for SIZE, GOT, and TLS relocations. `config/tc-riscv.h` defines `tc_fix_adjustable(fixup)` to 0 to prevent section symbol conversion.

`fix_segment` iterates over fixups and decides whether a fixup is applied as a constant or will become a relocation.

- Compute `add_number` if `fx_subsy`
- Compute `add_number` if `fx_addsy`
- Compute `add_number` if `fx_pcrel`
- If not `fx_done`, call target-specific `md_apply_fix`
- Call `symbol_mark_used_in_reloc` on `fx_addsy` and `fx_subsy`
- Check fixup value overflow

( `config/tc-arm.h` defines `TC_FORCE_RELOCATION_SUB_SAME` to force `R_ARM_REL32` relocations against Thumb functions.

`config/tc-riscv.c` defines `md_apply_fix` to split a fixup into two and add a `BFD_RELOC_RISCV_RELAX` fixup (`R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation) for linker-relaxable instructions. It also handles `BFD_RELOC_RISCV_SUB8, BFD_RELOC_RISCV_SUB16, BFD_RELOC_RISCV_SUB32, BFD_RELOC_RISCV_SUB64`.

For i386 ELF (REL relocations), `md_apply_fix` in `config/tc-i386.c` must pre-compensate for `bfd_install_relocation`'s subtraction of `reloc_entry->address` on `partial_inplace` PC-relative relocations. `BFD_RELOC_32_PCREL` and `BFD_RELOC_386_PLT32` add `fx_where + fr_address` (twice for section symbols) to the value before writing to instruction bytes, so that the final implicit addend is correct after `bfd_install_relocation`. The `value = -4` override for PLT32 is only used for the RELA case (x86-64), where `bfd_install_relocation` does not modify instruction bytes. )

Set up symbol table. Symbols equated to an undefined symbol are removed. ELF defines the `obj_frob_symbol` hook (`elf_frob_symbol`) to set `st_size`, visibility, and the [versioned name](https://maskray.me/blog/2020-11-26-all-about-symbol-versioning). Symbols equated to undefined or common symbols are removed. Unresolved symbols (`symbol_resolved_p`) lead to errors.

`tc_adjust_symtab` adjusts the symbol table. `config/tc-ppc.c` defines this hook to remove the special symbol `.TOC`.

`obj_adjust_symtab` adjusts the symbol table. ELF defines this hook (`elf_adjust_symtab`) to define group signature symbols as local if they are otherwise absent.

`write_relocs` writes relocations. `tc_gen_reloc` and `install_reloc` are called for each fixup. `install_reloc` calls `bfd_install_relocation` to update the relocated location. For `partial_inplace` PC-relative relocations with `pcrel_offset`, `bfd_install_relocation` subtracts `reloc_entry->address` from the instruction bytes via `apply_reloc`. This means `md_apply_fix` must pre-add `fx_where + fr_address` to compensate (see the hack in `config/tc-i386.c:md_apply_fix`). Failing to do so was the root cause of [PR gas/26263](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26263): `R_386_PLT32` against a section symbol got an implicit addend of -5 instead of -4.

ELF defines the `obj_frob_file_after_relocs` hook to update group section sizes.

`compress_debug` compresses debug sections.

`write_contents` writes section contents.

### Expression evaluation

There are [three expression evaluation strategies](https://sourceware.org/cgit/binutils-gdb/commit/?id=9497f5ac6bc10bdd65ea471787619bde1edca77d): `expr_normal`, `expr_evaluate`, and `expr_defer`.

For a binary operator, the `expr_defer` strategy skips evaluation if `S_IF_FORWARD_REF` is true for either operand. Otherwise, basic constant folding schemes are applied:

- constant OP constant
- x+constant and x-constant
- y-x when x and y are in the same subsection. In particular, the result can be folded if x and y are only separated by fill fragments.
- ...

`symbol_clone_if_forward_ref`, when called (primarily by `operand` with the `expr_evaluate`/`expr_normal` strategy), clones the expression tree.

For the `expr_evaluate` strategy, `resolve_expression` is additionally performed. The function computes arithmetic operations.

Here are some examples:

`.size exp`: `resolve_expression` called by `elf_frob_symbol` determines the size.

`.if exp`: `expression_and_evaluate` (`expr_evaluate` mode) parses the expression and calls `resolve_expression`. Regarding `x: call ext; y: .if y-x == 8` for RISC-V, `y-x` is folded to 8 even if `call ext` is linker relaxable. `HANDLE_CONDITIONAL_ASSEMBLY` in the read loop ignores the input if `current_cframe->ignoring`.

`.long y-x`: `fixup_segment` folds the expression if `sub_symbol_segment == add_symbol_segment && !S_FORCE_RELOC(x, 0) && !S_FORCE_RELOC(y, 0) && !TC_FORCE_RELOCATION_SUB_SAME (fixP, add_symbol_segment)`. `config/tc-riscv.c` defines `TC_FORCE_RELOCATION_SUB_SAME(seg)` as: seg is a special section (one of `absolute_section, undefined_section, reg_section, expr_section`) or seg contains code (possibly linker relaxable). As a result, `.long y-x` results in ADD/SUB relocations if x and y are defined in the same text section, even if they are not separated by a linker-relaxable instruction.

In July 2025, `.errif` and `.warnif` are introduced to utilize `deferred_expression` to emit diagnostics after fragment offsets are assigned.

### `.eh_frame` generation

`gas/dw2gencfi.c` generates the `.eh_frame` section from call-frame information directives.

## Notes on LLVM assembly and machine code emission

Clang has the capability to output either assembly code or an object file. Generating an object file directly without involving an assembler is referred to as "direct object emission."

To provide a unified interface, `MCStreamer` is created to handle the emission of both assembly code and object files. The two primary subclasses of `MCStreamer` are `MCAsmStreamer` and `MCObjectStreamer`, responsible for emitting assembly code and machine code respectively.

Now, let's see who communicates with the `MCStreamer` API.

In the data flow pipeline for compilation `C/C++ code -> LLVM IR -> MachineInstr -> MCInst -> assembly code/machine code`, LLVMAsmPrinter calls `MCStreamer` API to emit assembly code or machine code.

In the case of an assembly input file, LLVM creates an `MCAsmParser` object (LLVMMCParser) and a target-specific `MCTargetAsmParser` object. The `MCAsmParser` is responsible for tokenizing the input, parsing assembler directives, and invoking the `MCTargetAsmParser` to parse an instruction. Object file specific parsers (e.g. `ELFAsmParser`) and architecture-specific parsers (e.g. `X86AsmParser`) can extend `MCAsmParser` by overridding `MCAsmParserExtension` methods. Both the `MCAsmParser` and `MCTargetAsmParser` objects can call `MCStreamer` API to emit assembly code or machine code.

For an instruction parsed by the `MCTargetAsmParser`, if the streamer is an `MCAsmStreamer`, the `MCInst` will be pretty-printed by a target-specific `MCInstPrinter`. (`MCInstPrinter` is also used by disassembler tools like llvm-objdump, so it does not need a `MCAssembler`.) If the streamer is an `MCELFStreamer` (other object file formats are similar), `MCELFStreamer::emitInstToData` will use `${Target}MCCodeEmitter` from LLVM${Target}Desc to encode the `MCInst`, emit its byte sequence, and records needed relocations (`MCAssembler` and `ELFObjectWriter`). An `ELFObjectWriter` object is used to write the relocatable object file.

`MCAssembler` manages `MCAsmBackend`, `MCCodeEmitter`, and `MCObjectWriter`. Both `MCAsmStreamer` and `MCObjectStreamer` construct a `MCAssembler` instance.

- `MCObjectStreamer` requires all three instances to be available, so targets that implement machine code emission must implement `MCAsmBackend`.
- `MCAsmStreamer` allows all three to be nullptr. However, most targets implement `MCAsmBackend` and `MCObjectWriter` will be available as well. The instance holds some object file format specific states, even if we don't write an object file. The experimental ARC target does not implement `MCAsmBackend` or `MCObjectWriter`.

The SPIR-V target implements `SPIRVObjectWriter::writeObject` to write a SPIR-V module, comprising a header (including magic, version, generator, etc; see "Physical Layout of a SPIR-V Module and Instruction") followed by a linear sequence of instructions. These instructions reside in a single section (LLVMMC's text section) and are encoded by `SPIRVMCCodeEmitter`. The SPIR-V target also provides a minimal MCAsmBackend implementation.

## Notes on LLVM integrated assembler

## Symbol name prefixes

`PrivateGlobalPrefix`: Temporary symbols that are not saved in the symbol table unless `--save-temp-labels` is specified. `MCContext::createTempSymbol` and `MCContext::createNamedTempSymbol` prepend this prefix. On ELF/Wasm/GOFF, it is `.L`; on XCOFF, `L..`; on Mach-O, `L`.

`PrivateLabelPrefix` marks basic block labels. `MCContext::createBlockSymbol` prepends this prefix. In practice, `PrivateLabelPrefix` equals `PrivateGlobalPrefix` on all targets.

`LinkerPrivateGlobalPrefix` (Mach-O specific: "l") marks a non-temporary symbol that can be used as an atom. The symbol is not external and will be discarded during linking. For ELF targets, the `MCContext::createLinkerPrivateTempSymbol` function creates a temporary symbol starting with ".L".

`.L` as a prefix is better than `L`: `.L` prevents name collision with user-defined symbols. Object file formats that use L typically decorate regular symbols with _ to avoid name collision, which causes uglier names. ([BPF doesn't use `.L`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/95103))

The LLVM terminology ("Private") is misleading. These symbols are not related to ELF visibility (`STV_DEFAULT`/`STV_HIDDEN`); they are assembler-internal symbols stripped before the object file. "Global" in `PrivateGlobalPrefix` is also confusing — these symbols are the opposite of global in the ELF sense. GNU assembler documentation historically called `.L`-prefixed symbols "local symbols", which conflated with ELF `STB_LOCAL` binding. A [2026 GNU as documentation patch](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2026-February/148305.html) renames the concept to "internal symbols" and "numeric local labels" (for `N:`/`Nb`/`Nf`). LLVM could benefit from a similar rename (e.g., `InternalSymbolPrefix`, `InternalLabelPrefix`, `LinkerInternalPrefix`) to reduce confusion.

### Workflow

TODO

```plaintext
MCAssembler::Finish
  MCAssembler::layout
    MCAssembler::layoutSection
    MCAssembler::relaxOnce
    MCAssembler::evaluateFixup
      X86AsmBackend::applyFixup
        ELFObjectWriter::recordRelocation
  ELFObjectWriter::writeObject
    ELFWriter::writeSectionData
```

Both the GNU assembler and LLVM integrated assembler utilize multiple passes during assembly, with several key phases:

- Parsing phase: The assembler constructs section fragments. These fragments represent sequences of regular instructions or data, span-dependent instructions, alignment directives, and other elements.
- Section layout phase: `MCAssembler::layout` arranges each section by assigning precise offsets to its fragments - instructions, data, or other directives (e.g., `.line`, `.uleb128`). This process calculates fragment sizes and adjusts for alignment, ultimately finalizing the offsets for all symbols within the section. The layout process involves two main passes that are called in a pair:

    - `layoutSection`: This pass assigns initial offsets to each fragment. This is also called when `relaxOnce` has made any change.
    - `relaxOnce`: This pass evaluates span-dependent fragments but does not update their offsets. This ensures that label differences are calculated using offsets from the same iteration.
- Write phase

    - [Relocation decision phase](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-03-16-relocation-generation-in-assemblers): The assembler evaluates fixups and, if necessary, updates the content of the fragments.

Some expressions cannot use relocations (e.g., `.size` and `.fill` directives). They set `InSet` as a parameter in various methods in `llvm/lib/MC/`. This makes expression evaluation different based on the context and should be generally avoided if possible. This issue is aggravated by the fact that LLVMMC seems to misuse `InSet` and makes `InSet` affect the behavior in situations where it doesn't need to. Unfortunately, the uses are a bit messy. Additionally, `InSet` appears to be used as a workaround for Mach-O in some places, specifically related to its `.subsections_via_symbols` mechanism.

When assembling an assembly file into an object file, an expression can be evaluated in multiple steps. Two steps are particularly important:

- Parsing time. At this stage, We have a `MCAssembler` object but no `MCAsmLayout` object. Instruction operands and certain directives like `.if` require the ability to evaluate an expression early.
- Object file writing time. At this stage, we have both a `MCAssembler` object and a `MCAsmLayout` object. The `MCAsmLayout` object provides information about the offset of each fragment.

### LLVM-specific directives

`.lto_discard` is an LLVM-specific directive that ignores label and symbol attributes for specified symbols. LLVMLTO uses the directive to ignore non-prevailing symbols in module-level inline assembly during regular LTO (e.g., `module asm ".weak foo"\nmodule asm ".equ foo,bar"`).

[`.lto_set_conditional sym1, sym2`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D113613) is an LLVM-specific directive that is a variant of equates (`.set`, `.equ`, `.equiv`). `sym1` is defined only if `sym2` is defined. If we create an alias for a symbol defined by module-level inline assembly, we can avoid creating the symbol if the aliasee is dropped by LTO.

z/OS uses IBM High Level Assembler (HLASM). IBM added some support to LLVMMCParser in 2021.

### Inline assembly

There are 3 code paths:

- `-fno-integrated-as` (except XCOFF for AIX): emit raw assembly to `MCAsmStreamer` to without parsing/checking
- `-S -fintegrated-as` (also `-c --save-temps -fintegrated-as`): parse, check, and emit object code to `MCAsmStreamer`
- `-c -fintegrated-as`: parse, check, and emit object code to `MCObjectStreamer`

Parsing inline assembly with LLVMMCParser allows validation and formatting purposes. In addition, knowing the number of instructions helps implement precise branch relaxation.

#### MSVC inline assembly

`__asm` blocks are parsed for Windows target triples. This extension is available on other targets by specifying `-fasm-blocks` or the broad `-fms-extensions`. An `__asm` statement is represented as a `clang::MSAsmStmt` object. `clang::Parser::ParseMicrosoftAsmStatement` parses the inline assembly string and calls `llvm::AsmParser::parseMSInlineAsm`. It is worth noting that the string may be modified during this process. For a `clang::MSAsmStmt` object, LLVM IR is generated through `clang::CodeGen::CodeGenFunction::EmitAsmStmt`.

### Span-dependent instruction optimization

LLVM MC calls this assembler relaxation.

```plaintext
foo: nop; jmp foo
```

With `clang --target=x86_64 -c -mrelax-all` (`llvm-mc -mc-relax-all`), LLVM integrated assembler uses the 5-byte encoding instead of the relaxable 2-byte encoding.

```plaintext
foo: c.beqz a0, foo
```

With `clang --target=riscv64 -c -mrelax-all`, LLVM integrated assembler splits the instruction into two: `bnez a0, .+6; j foo`.

A few tests help test the fragment relaxation framework. 1

### Generated debug information

If `-g` is specified and none of `.file` and `.loc` is used, LLVM integrated assembler synthesizes debug information.

### `.debug_line` creation

After parsing an instruction or directive, `MCObjectStreamer::emitBytes` is called to emit bytes. If we have seen a `.loc` directive (either user-specified or synthesized), we create a temporary label at the current location and add a `MCDwarfLineEntry` entry to the current section.

After the file is parsed, `MCObjectStreamer::finishImpl` calls `MCDwarfLineTable::emit` to emit `.debug_line`.

For each line entry, `MCDwarfLineTable::emitOne` computes how to increment the location and the line number. `MCObjectStreamer::emitDwarfAdvanceLineAddr` emits `DW_LNE_set_address` to set the address for the first entry. For the other entries, `MCObjectStreamer::emitDwarfAdvanceLineAddr` selects one of the opcodes in decreasing precedence: `DW_LNS_copy`, standard opcode, `DW_LNS_const_add_pc` plus standard opcode, `DW_LNS_advance_pc`.

There was a "fast path" (`if (AddrDelta->evaluateAsAbsolute(Res, getAssemblerPtr()))`) to emit a byte sequence instead of a `MCDwarfLineAddrFragment`.

### Symbol equating directives

Before [May 2025](https://maskray.me/blog/2025-05-26-llvm-integrated-assembler-improving-expressions-and-relocations), LLVM's integrated assembler only allowed reassignment for `MCConstantExpr` cases, as it struggled with scenarios like:

```plaintext
.data
.set x, 0
.long x         // reference the first instance
x = .-.data
.long x         // reference the second instance
.set x,.-.data
.long x         // reference the third instance
```

### Expression evaluation

- `evaluateKnownAbsolute`: rarely used. One use case is `.size end-start` to force evaluating to a constant even if the two symbols are separated by a linker-relaxable instruction

TODO span-dependent instructions. _Assembling code for machines with span-dependent instructions_, 1978

Thomas G. Szymanski, _Assembling Code for Machines with Span-Dependent Instructions_, April 1978, coined the term "span-dependent instructions". _AIX PS/2 and System/370 Programming Tools and Interfaces_ refers to the term and defines `.optim` and `.noopt`. There is no more information. It's possible that AIX PS/2 and System/370 only use .optim/.noopt for branches, a restricted form of the general span-dependent expressions.

In LLVM, variable evaluation has a pipe of hacks. `isInSection` utilizes `isAbsolute`, which requires `MCExpr::findAssociatedFragment` for a variable.

In GNU assembler, .optim/.noopt has been ignored for a long time (since 1992).

https://reviews.llvm.org/D109109 `getSymbolOffsetImpl` is recursively called due to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/19577

### Mach-O

Apple cctools assembler was modified from binutils. It contains code not in upstream binutils, e.g. `.subsections_via_symbols`.

Mach-O's subsection feature imposes restriction on label differences. In general, label differences that cross an atom symbol is not allowed as instruction operands.

```plaintext
La: nop
Lb:

a: nop
b:

add x0, x0, Lb-La  // ok
add x0, x0, b-a    // rejected, different atoms
```

However, `.set` directives and equates (`var = b-a;`) resolve label differences disregarding the atom restriction.

In addition, the `.set` directive suppresses relocations (`SetDirectiveSuppressesReloc = true;`). `X86MCAsmInfoDarwin::X86MCAsmInfoDarwin` sets `DwarfFDESymbolsUseAbsDiff`

### Mach-O `a = b + 4; .long a` hack

Normally, relocations referencing a variable are redirected to the symbol in the resolved expression. However, to [maintain compatibility with Apple cctools assembler](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/19577), when the addend is non-zero, the relocation symbol uses the variable itself.

```plaintext
.data
a = b + 4
.long a   # ARM64_RELOC_UNSIGNED(a) instead of b; This might work around the linker bug(?) when the referenced symbol is b and the addend is 4.

c = d
.long c   # ARM64_RELOC_UNSIGNED(d)

y:
x = y + 4
.long x   # ARM64_RELOC_UNSIGNED(x) instead of y
```

This leads to another workaround in `MCFragment.cpp:getSymbolOffsetImpl`: [[MC] Recursively calculate symbol offset](https://reviews.llvm.org/D109109). This workaround is to support the following assembly:

```plaintext
l_a:
l_b = l_a + 1
l_c = l_b
.long l_c
```

### Mach-O label differences

In the LLVM integrated assembler, at layout time, `MCAssembler::relaxDwarfCallFrameFragment` evaluates a label difference created by a CFI instruction.

For Mach-O, if a non-private label appears between a pair of `.cfi_startproc` and `.cfi_endproc`, the `.cfi_startproc` and `.cfi_offset` will be associated with different atoms.

```plaintext
.cfi_startproc
_foo:
  .cfi_offset 0, 0
.cfi_endproc
```

and you will see an error since LLVM 19 ([https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/75006466296ed4b0f845cbbec4bf77c21de43b40](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/75006466296ed4b0f845cbbec4bf77c21de43b40)). 1
