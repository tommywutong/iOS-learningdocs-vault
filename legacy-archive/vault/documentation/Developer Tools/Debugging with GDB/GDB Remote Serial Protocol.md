# [GDB Remote Serial Protocol](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqgi)

## [Overview](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqgm)

There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol--for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for GDB.

In the examples below, `` `->' `` and `` `<-' `` are used to indicate
transmitted and received data respectfully.

All GDB commands and responses (other than acknowledgments) are
sent as a packet. A packet is introduced with the character
`` `$' ``, the actual packet-data, and the terminating character
`` `#' `` followed by a two-digit checksum:

```
$packet-data#checksum
```


The two-digit checksum is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading `` `$' `` and the trailing `` `#' `` (an
eight bit unsigned checksum).

Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit sequence-id:

```
$sequence-id:packet-data#checksum
```


That sequence-id was appended to the acknowledgment. GDB
has never output sequence-ids. Stubs that handle packets added
since GDB 5.0 must not accept sequence-id.

When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgment: either `` `+' `` (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or `` `-' `` (to request
retransmission):

```
-> $packet-data#checksum
<- +
```

The host (GDB) sends commands, and the target (the
debugging stub incorporated in your program) sends a response. In
the case of step and continue commands, the response is only sent
when the operation has completed (the target has again stopped).

packet-data consists of a sequence of characters with the
exception of `` `#' `` and `` `$' `` (see `` `X' `` packet for additional
exceptions).

Fields within the packet should be separated using `` `,' `` `` `;' `` or

`` `:' ``. Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in
HEX with leading zeros suppressed.

Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0, the character
`` `:' `` could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it
would potentially conflict with the sequence-id).

Response data can be run-length encoded to save space. A `` `*' ``
means that the next character is an ASCII encoding giving a repeat count
which stands for that many repetitions of the character preceding the
`` `*' ``. The encoding is `n+29`, yielding a printable character
where `n >=3` (which is where rle starts to win). The printable
characters `` `$' ``, `` `#' ``, `` `+' `` and `` `-' `` or with a numeric
value greater than 126 should not be used.

So:

```
"0* "
```

means the same as "0000".

The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number. That number is not well defined.

For any command not supported by the stub, an empty response
(`` `$#00' ``) should be returned. That way it is possible to extend the
protocol. A newer GDB can tell if a packet is supported based
on that response.

A stub is required to support the `` `g' ``, `` `G' ``, `` `m' ``, `` `M' ``,
`` `c' ``, and `` `s' `` commands. All other commands are
optional.

## [Packets](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqgq)

The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
commands and their corresponding response data.
See section [File-I/O remote protocol extension](#apple-kncugmzqhe), for details about the File
I/O extension of the remote protocol.

: 
Enable extended mode. In extended mode, the remote server is made
persistent. The `` `R' `` packet is used to restart the program being
debugged.
Reply:

: The remote target both supports and has enabled extended mode.

**`?` -- last signal**
: 
Indicate the reason the target halted. The reply is the same as for
step and continue.

**`b`baud -- set baud __(deprecated)__**
: 
Change the serial line speed to baud.
JTC: _When does the transport layer state change? When it's
received, or after the ACK is transmitted. In either case, there are
problems if the command or the acknowledgment packet is dropped._
Stan: _If people really wanted to add something like this, and get
it working for the first time, they ought to modify ser-unix.c to send
some kind of out-of-band message to a specially-setup stub and have the
switch happen "in between" packets, so that from remote protocol's point
of view, nothing actually happened._

**`B`addr,mode -- set breakpoint __(deprecated)__**
: 
Set (mode is `` `S' ``) or clear (mode is `` `C' ``) a
breakpoint at addr.
This packet has been replaced by the `` `Z' `` and `` `z' `` packets

**`g` -- read registers**
: @anchor{read registers packet}

Read general registers.
Reply:

**`` `XX...' ``**
: Each byte of register data is described by two hex digits. The bytes
with the register are transmitted in target byte order. The size of
each register and their position within the `` `g' `` packet are
determined by the GDB internal macros
DEPRECATED_REGISTER_RAW_SIZE and REGISTER_NAME macros. The
specification of several standard `g` packets is specified below.

`` `G' ``, et.al.). c depends on the operation to be performed: it
should be `` `c' `` for step and continue operations, `` `g' `` for other
operations. The thread designator t... may be -1, meaning all
the threads, a thread number, or zero which means pick any thread.

to read only part of the data. Neither GDB nor the stub assume
that sized memory transfers are assumed using word aligned
accesses. FIXME: _A word aligned memory transfer mechanism is
needed._

leading upper case letter. Custom vendor queries should use a company
prefix (in lower case) ex: `` `qfsf.var' ``. query may optionally
be followed by a `` `,' `` or `` `;' `` separated list. Stubs must ensure
that they match the full query name.
Reply:

up to the first `;` or `?` (or the end of the packet).

**`vCont`[;action[`:`tid]]... -- extended resume**
: 
Resume the inferior. Different actions may be specified for each thread.
If an action is specified with no tid, then it is applied to any
threads that don't have a specific action specified; if no default action is
specified then other threads should remain stopped. Specifying multiple
default actions is an error; specifying no actions is also an error.
Thread IDs are specified in hexadecimal. Currently supported actions are:

**`vCont?` -- extended resume query**
: 
Query support for the `vCont` packet.
Reply:

**`` `vCont[;action]...' ``**
: The `vCont` packet is supported. Each action is a supported
command in the `vCont` packet.

**`` `' ``**
: The `vCont` packet is not supported.

**`z`type`,`addr`,`length -- remove breakpoint or watchpoint __(draft)__**
:

**`Z`type`,`addr`,`length -- insert breakpoint or watchpoint __(draft)__**
: @anchor{insert breakpoint or watchpoint packet}

Insert (`Z`) or remove (`z`) a type breakpoint or
watchpoint starting at address address and covering the next
length bytes.
Each breakpoint and watchpoint packet type is documented
separately.
_Implementation notes: A remote target shall return an empty string
for an unrecognized breakpoint or watchpoint packet type. A
remote target shall support either both or neither of a given
`Z`type... and `z`type... packet pair. To
avoid potential problems with duplicate packets, the operations should
be implemented in an idempotent way._

**`z``0``,`addr`,`length -- remove memory breakpoint __(draft)__**
:

**`Z``0``,`addr`,`length -- insert memory breakpoint __(draft)__**
: 

Insert (`Z0`) or remove (`z0`) a memory breakpoint at address
`addr` of size `length`.
A memory breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at
addr with a software breakpoint or trap instruction. The
`length` is used by targets that indicates the size of the
breakpoint (in bytes) that should be inserted (e.g., the ARM and
MIPS can insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint).
_Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
code that contains memory breakpoints (e.g., when implementing
overlays). The behavior of this packet, in the presence of such a
target, is not defined._
Reply:

**`` `OK' ``**
: success

**`` `' ``**
: not supported

**`` `ENN' ``**
: for an error

**`z``1``,`addr`,`length -- remove hardware breakpoint __(draft)__**
:

**`Z``1``,`addr`,`length -- insert hardware breakpoint __(draft)__**
: 

Insert (`Z1`) or remove (`z1`) a hardware breakpoint at
address `addr` of size `length`.
A hardware breakpoint is implemented using a mechanism that is not
dependant on being able to modify the target's memory.
_Implementation note: A hardware breakpoint is not affected by code
movement._

## [Stop Reply Packets](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqgu)

The `` `C' ``, `` `c' ``, `` `S' ``, `` `s' `` and `` `?' `` packets can
receive any of the below as a reply. In the case of the `` `C' ``,
`` `c' ``, `` `S' `` and `` `s' `` packets, that reply is only returned
when the target halts. In the below the exact meaning of `` `signal
number' `` is poorly defined. In general one of the UNIX signal numbering
conventions is used.

**`` `SAA' ``**
: AA is the signal number

**`` `TAAn...:r...;n...:r...;n...:r...;' ``**
: 
AA = two hex digit signal number; n... = register number
(hex), r... = target byte ordered register contents, size defined
by `DEPRECATED_REGISTER_RAW_SIZE`; n... = `` `thread' ``,
r... = thread process ID, this is a hex integer; n... =
(`` `watch' `` | `` `rwatch' `` | `` `awatch' ``, r... = data
address, this is a hex integer; n... = other string not starting
with valid hex digit. GDB should ignore this n...,
r... pair and go on to the next. This way we can extend the
protocol.

**`` `WAA' ``**
: The process exited, and AA is the exit status. This is only
applicable to certain targets.

**`` `XAA' ``**
: The process terminated with signal AA.

**`` `OXX...' ``**
: XX... is hex encoding of ASCII data. This can happen at
any time while the program is running and the debugger should continue
to wait for `` `W' ``, `` `T' ``, etc.

**`` `Fcall-id,parameter...' ``**
: call-id is the identifier which says which host system call should
be called. This is just the name of the function. Translation into the
correct system call is only applicable as it's defined in GDB.
See section [File-I/O remote protocol extension](#apple-kncugmzqhe), for a list of implemented
system calls.
parameter... is a list of parameters as defined for this very
system call.
The target replies with this packet when it expects GDB to call
a host system call on behalf of the target. GDB replies with
an appropriate `F` packet and keeps up waiting for the next reply
packet from the target. The latest `` `C' ``, `` `c' ``, `` `S' `` or
`` `s' `` action is expected to be continued.
See section [File-I/O remote protocol extension](#apple-kncugmzqhe), for more details.

## [General Query Packets](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqgy)

The following set and query packets have already been defined.

**`q``C` -- current thread**
: 

Return the current thread id.
Reply:

**`` `QCpid' ``**
: Where pid is an unsigned hexidecimal process id.

**`` `*' ``**
: Any other reply implies the old pid.

**`q``fThreadInfo` -- all thread ids**
: 

`q``sThreadInfo`
Obtain a list of active thread ids from the target (OS). Since there
may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet, this query
works iteratively: it may require more than one query/reply sequence to
obtain the entire list of threads. The first query of the sequence will
be the `qf``ThreadInfo` query; subsequent queries in the
sequence will be the `qs``ThreadInfo` query.
NOTE: replaces the `qL` query (see below).
Reply:

**`` `mid' ``**
: A single thread id

**`` `mid,id...' ``**
: a comma-separated list of thread ids

**`` `l' ``**
: (lower case 'el') denotes end of list.

In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one or
more thread ids, in big-endian unsigned hex, separated by commas.
GDB will respond to each reply with a request for more thread
ids (using the `qs` form of the query), until the target responds
with `l` (lower-case el, for `'last'`).

**`q``ThreadExtraInfo``,`id -- extra thread info**
: 

Where id is a thread-id in big-endian hex. Obtain a printable
string description of a thread's attributes from the target OS. This
string may contain anything that the target OS thinks is interesting for
GDB to tell the user about the thread. The string is displayed
in GDB's `` `info threads' `` display. Some examples of
possible thread extra info strings are "Runnable", or "Blocked on
Mutex".
Reply:

**`` `XX...' ``**
: Where XX... is a hex encoding of ASCII data, comprising
the printable string containing the extra information about the thread's
attributes.

**`q``L`startflagthreadcountnextthread -- query LIST or threadLIST __(deprecated)__**
: Obtain thread information from RTOS. Where: startflag (one hex
digit) is one to indicate the first query and zero to indicate a
subsequent query; threadcount (two hex digits) is the maximum
number of threads the response packet can contain; and nextthread
(eight hex digits), for subsequent queries (startflag is zero), is
returned in the response as argthread.
NOTE: this query is replaced by the `q``fThreadInfo` query
(see above).
Reply:

**`` `qMcountdoneargthreadthread...' ``**
: Where: count (two hex digits) is the number of threads being
returned; done (one hex digit) is zero to indicate more threads
and one indicates no further threads; argthreadid (eight hex
digits) is nextthread from the request packet; thread...
is a sequence of thread IDs from the target. threadid (eight hex
digits). See `remote.c:parse_threadlist_response()`.

**`q``CRC:`addr`,`length -- compute CRC of memory block**
: 

Reply:

**`` `ENN' ``**
: An error (such as memory fault)

**`` `CCRC32' ``**
: A 32 bit cyclic redundancy check of the specified memory region.

**`q``Offsets` -- query sect offs**
: 

Get section offsets that the target used when re-locating the downloaded
image. _Note: while a `Bss` offset is included in the
response, GDB ignores this and instead applies the `Data`
offset to the `Bss` section._
Reply:

**`` `Text=xxx;Data=yyy;Bss=zzz' ``**
:

**`q``P`modethreadid -- thread info request**
: 

Returns information on threadid. Where: mode is a hex
encoded 32 bit mode; threadid is a hex encoded 64 bit thread ID.
Reply:

**`` `*' ``**
:

See `remote.c:remote_unpack_thread_info_response()`.

**`q``Rcmd,`command -- remote command**
: 

command (hex encoded) is passed to the local interpreter for
execution. Invalid commands should be reported using the output string.
Before the final result packet, the target may also respond with a
number of intermediate `O`output console output packets.
_Implementors should note that providing access to a stubs's
interpreter may have security implications_.
Reply:

**`` `OK' ``**
: A command response with no output.

**`` `OUTPUT' ``**
: A command response with the hex encoded output string OUTPUT.

**`` `ENN' ``**
: Indicate a badly formed request.

**``` ``'' ```**
: When `` `q' ```` `Rcmd' `` is not recognized.

z

**`qSymbol::` -- symbol lookup**
: 

Notify the target that GDB is prepared to serve symbol lookup
requests. Accept requests from the target for the values of symbols.
Reply:

**`` `OK' ``**
: The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.

**`` `qSymbol:sym_name' ``**
: The target requests the value of symbol sym_name (hex encoded).
GDB may provide the value by using the
`qSymbol:`sym_value:sym_name message, described below.

**`qSymbol:`sym_value:sym_name -- symbol value**
: Set the value of sym_name to sym_value.
sym_name (hex encoded) is the name of a symbol whose value the
target has previously requested.
sym_value (hex) is the value for symbol sym_name. If
GDB cannot supply a value for sym_name, then this field
will be empty.
Reply:

**`` `OK' ``**
: The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.

**`` `qSymbol:sym_name' ``**
: The target requests the value of a new symbol sym_name (hex
encoded). GDB will continue to supply the values of symbols
(if available), until the target ceases to request them.

**`qPart`:object:`read`:annex:offset,length -- read special data**
: 

Read uninterpreted bytes from the target's special data area
identified by the keyword `object`.
Request length bytes starting at offset bytes into the data.
The content and encoding of annex is specific to the object;
it can supply additional details about what data to access.
Here are the specific requests of this form defined so far.
All `` `qPart:object:read:...' ``
requests use the same reply formats, listed below.

**`qPart`:`auxv`:`read`::offset,length**
: Access the target's __auxiliary vector__. See section [Operating system auxiliary information](Examining%20Data.md#apple-kncugnrz), and see section [Remote configuration](Debugging%20remote%20programs.md#apple-kncugmjwga). Note annex must be empty.

Reply:

**`OK`**
: The offset in the request is at the end of the data.
There is no more data to be read.

**XX...**
: Hex encoded data bytes read.
This may be fewer bytes than the length in the request.

**`E00`**
: The request was malformed, or annex was invalid.

**`E`nn**
: The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered reading the data.
nn is a hex-encoded `errno` value.

**`""` (empty)**
: An empty reply indicates the object or annex string was not
recognized by the stub.

**`qPart`:object:`write`:annex:offset:data...**
: 
Write uninterpreted bytes into the target's special data area
identified by the keyword `object`,
starting at offset bytes into the data.
data... is the hex-encoded data to be written.
The content and encoding of annex is specific to the object;
it can supply additional details about what data to access.
No requests of this form are presently in use. This specification
serves as a placeholder to document the common format that new
specific request specifications ought to use.
Reply:

**nn**
: nn (hex encoded) is the number of bytes written.
This may be fewer bytes than supplied in the request.

**`E00`**
: The request was malformed, or annex was invalid.

**`E`nn**
: The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered writing the data.
nn is a hex-encoded `errno` value.

**`""` (empty)**
: An empty reply indicates the object or annex string was not
recognized by the stub, or that the object does not support writing.

**`qPart`:object:operation:...**
: Requests of this form may be added in the future. When a stub does
not recognize the object keyword, or its support for
object does not recognize the operation keyword,
the stub must respond with an empty packet.

**`qGetTLSAddr`:thread-id,offset,lm -- get thread local storage address**
: 

Fetch the address associated with thread local storage specified
by thread-id, offset, and lm.
thread-id is the (big endian, hex encoded) thread id associated with the
thread for which to fetch the TLS address.
offset is the (big endian, hex encoded) offset associated with the
thread local variable. (This offset is obtained from the debug
information associated with the variable.)
lm is the (big endian, hex encoded) OS/ABI specific encoding of the
the load module associated with the thread local storage. For example,
a GNU/Linux system will pass the link map address of the shared
object associated with the thread local storage under consideration.
Other operating environments may choose to represent the load module
differently, so the precise meaning of this parameter will vary.
Reply:

**XX...**
: Hex encoded (big endian) bytes representing the address of the thread
local storage requested.

**`E`nn (where nn are hex digits)**
: An error occurred.

**`""` (empty)**
: An empty reply indicates that `qGetTLSAddr` is not supported by the stub.

Use of this request packet is controlled by the `set remote
get-thread-local-storage-address` command (see section [Remote configuration](Debugging%20remote%20programs.md#apple-kncugmjwga)).

## [Register Packet Format](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqg4)

The following `` `g' ``/`` `G' `` packets have previously been defined.
In the below, some thirty-two bit registers are transferred as
sixty-four bits. Those registers should be zero/sign extended (which?)
to fill the space allocated. Register bytes are transfered in target
byte order. The two nibbles within a register byte are transfered
most-significant - least-significant.

**MIPS32**
: All registers are transfered as thirty-two bit quantities in the order:
32 general-purpose; sr; lo; hi; bad; cause; pc; 32 floating-point
registers; fsr; fir; fp.

**MIPS64**
: All registers are transfered as sixty-four bit quantities (including
thirty-two bit registers such as `sr`). The ordering is the same
as `MIPS32`.

## [Examples](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqha)

## [File-I/O remote protocol extension](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzqhe)

### [File-I/O Overview](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzrga)

The __File I/O remote protocol extension__ (short: File-I/O) allows the
target to use the host's file system and console I/O when calling various
system calls. System calls on the target system are translated into a
remote protocol packet to the host system which then performs the needed
actions and returns with an adequate response packet to the target system.
This simulates file system operations even on targets that lack file systems.

The protocol is defined host- and target-system independent. It uses
its own independent representation of datatypes and values. Both,
GDB and the target's GDB stub are responsible for
translating the system dependent values into the unified protocol values
when data is transmitted.

The communication is synchronous. A system call is possible only
when GDB is waiting for the `` `C' ``, `` `c' ``, `` `S' `` or `` `s' ``
packets. While GDB handles the request for a system call,
the target is stopped to allow deterministic access to the target's
memory. Therefore File-I/O is not interuptible by target signals. It
is possible to interrupt File-I/O by a user interrupt (Ctrl-C), though.

The target's request to perform a host system call does not finish
the latest `` `C' ``, `` `c' ``, `` `S' `` or `` `s' `` action. That means,
after finishing the system call, the target returns to continuing the
previous activity (continue, step). No additional continue or step
request from GDB is required.

```swift
(gdb) continue
  <- target requests 'system call X'
  target is stopped, GDB executes system call
  -> GDB returns result
  ... target continues, GDB returns to wait for the target
  <- target hits breakpoint and sends a Txx packet
```

The protocol is only used for files on the host file system and
for I/O on the console. Character or block special devices, pipes,
named pipes or sockets or any other communication method on the host
system are not supported by this protocol.

### [Protocol basics](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzrge)

The File-I/O protocol uses the `F` packet, as request as well
as as reply packet. Since a File-I/O system call can only occur when
GDB is waiting for the continuing or stepping target, the
File-I/O request is a reply that GDB has to expect as a result
of a former `` `C' ``, `` `c' ``, `` `S' `` or `` `s' `` packet.
This `F` packet contains all information needed to allow GDB
to call the appropriate host system call:

- A unique identifier for the requested system call.
- All parameters to the system call. Pointers are given as addresses
  in the target memory address space. Pointers to strings are given as
  pointer/length pair. Numerical values are given as they are.
  Numerical control values are given in a protocol specific representation.

At that point GDB has to perform the following actions.

- If parameter pointer values are given, which point to data needed as input
  to a system call, GDB requests this data from the target with a
  standard `m` packet request. This additional communication has to be
  expected by the target implementation and is handled as any other `m`
  packet.
- GDB translates all value from protocol representation to host
  representation as needed. Datatypes are coerced into the host types.
- GDB calls the system call
- It then coerces datatypes back to protocol representation.
- If pointer parameters in the request packet point to buffer space in which
  a system call is expected to copy data to, the data is transmitted to the
  target using a `M` or `X` packet. This packet has to be expected
  by the target implementation and is handled as any other `M` or `X`
  packet.

Eventually GDB replies with another `F` packet which contains all
necessary information for the target to continue. This at least contains

- Return value.
- `errno`, if has been changed by the system call.
- "Ctrl-C" flag.

After having done the needed type and value coercion, the target continues
the latest continue or step action.

### [The `F` request packet](gdb_toc.md#apple-krhugmzrgi)

The `F` request packet has the following format:

```
Fcall-id,parameter...
```

call-id is the identifier to indicate the host system call to be called.
This is just the name of the function.
parameter... are the parameters to the system call.

Parameters are hexadecimal integer values, either the real values in case
of scalar datatypes, as pointers to target buffer space in case of compound
datatypes and unspecified memory areas or as pointer/length pairs in case
of string parameters. These are appended to the call-id, each separated
from its predecessor by a comma. All values are transmitted in ASCII
string representation, pointer/length pairs separated by a slash.

### [The `F` reply packet](gdb_toc.md#apple-krhugmzrgm)

The `F` reply packet has the following format:

```
Fretcode,errno,Ctrl-C flag;call specific attachment
```

retcode is the return code of the system call as hexadecimal value.
errno is the errno set by the call, in protocol specific representation.
This parameter can be omitted if the call was successful.
Ctrl-C flag is only send if the user requested a break. In this
case, errno must be send as well, even if the call was successful.
The Ctrl-C flag itself consists of the character 'C':

```
F0,0,C
```

or, if the call was interupted before the host call has been performed:

```
F-1,4,C
```

assuming 4 is the protocol specific representation of `EINTR`.

### [Memory transfer](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzrgq)

Structured data which is transferred using a memory read or write as e.g.
a `struct stat` is expected to be in a protocol specific format with
all scalar multibyte datatypes being big endian. This should be done by
the target before the `F` packet is sent resp. by GDB before
it transfers memory to the target. Transferred pointers to structured
data should point to the already coerced data at any time.

### [The Ctrl-C message](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzrgu)

A special case is, if the Ctrl-C flag is set in the GDB
reply packet. In this case the target should behave, as if it had
gotten a break message. The meaning for the target is "system call
interupted by `SIGINT`". Consequentially, the target should actually stop
(as with a break message) and return to GDB with a `T02`
packet. In this case, it's important for the target to know, in which
state the system call was interrupted. Since this action is by design
not an atomic operation, we have to differ between two cases:

- The system call hasn't been performed on the host yet.
- The system call on the host has been finished.

These two states can be distinguished by the target by the value of the
returned `errno`. If it's the protocol representation of `EINTR`, the system
call hasn't been performed. This is equivalent to the `EINTR` handling
on POSIX systems. In any other case, the target may presume that the
system call has been finished -- successful or not -- and should behave
as if the break message arrived right after the system call.

GDB must behave reliable. If the system call has not been called
yet, GDB may send the `F` reply immediately, setting `EINTR` as
`errno` in the packet. If the system call on the host has been finished
before the user requests a break, the full action must be finshed by
GDB. This requires sending `M` or `X` packets as they fit.
The `F` packet may only be send when either nothing has happened
or the full action has been completed.

### [Console I/O](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzrgy)

By default and if not explicitely closed by the target system, the file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the GDB console. Output
on the GDB console is handled as any other file output operation
(`write(1, ...)` or `write(2, ...)`). Console input is handled
by GDB so that after the target read request from file descriptor
0 all following typing is buffered until either one of the following
conditions is met:

- The user presses `Ctrl-C`. The behaviour is as explained above, the
  `read`
  system call is treated as finished.
- The user presses `Enter`. This is treated as end of input with a trailing
  line feed.
- The user presses `Ctrl-D`. This is treated as end of input. No trailing
  character, especially no Ctrl-D is appended to the input.

If the user has typed more characters as fit in the buffer given to
the read call, the trailing characters are buffered in GDB until
either another `read(0, ...)` is requested by the target or debugging
is stopped on users request.

### [The `` `isatty' `` function call](gdb_toc.md#apple-krhugmzrg4)

A special case in this protocol is the library call `isatty` which
is implemented as its own call inside of this protocol. It returns
1 to the target if the file descriptor given as parameter is attached
to the GDB console, 0 otherwise. Implementing through system calls
would require implementing `ioctl` and would be more complex than
needed.

### [The `` `system' `` function call](gdb_toc.md#apple-krhugmzrha)

The other special case in this protocol is the `system` call which
is implemented as its own call, too. GDB is taking over the full
task of calling the necessary host calls to perform the `system`
call. The return value of `system` is simplified before it's returned
to the target. Basically, the only signal transmitted back is `EINTR`
in case the user pressed `Ctrl-C`. Otherwise the return value consists
entirely of the exit status of the called command.

Due to security concerns, the `system` call is by default refused
by GDB. The user has to allow this call explicitly with the
`set remote system-call-allowed 1` command.

**`set remote system-call-allowed`**
: 
Control whether to allow the `system` calls in the File I/O
protocol for the remote target. The default is zero (disabled).

**`show remote system-call-allowed`**
: 
Show the current setting of system calls for the remote File I/O
protocol.

### [Protocol specific representation of datatypes](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztge)

#### [Integral datatypes](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztgi)

The integral datatypes used in the system calls are

```
int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, mode_t and time_t
```

`Int`, `unsigned int`, `mode_t` and `time_t` are
implemented as 32 bit values in this protocol.

`Long` and `unsigned long` are implemented as 64 bit types.

See section [Limits](#apple-kncugmzuge), for corresponding MIN and MAX values (similar to those
in `limits.h') to allow range checking on host and target.

`time_t` datatypes are defined as seconds since the Epoch.

All integral datatypes transferred as part of a memory read or write of a
structured datatype e.g. a `struct stat` have to be given in big endian
byte order.

#### [Pointer values](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztgm)

Pointers to target data are transmitted as they are. An exception
is made for pointers to buffers for which the length isn't
transmitted as part of the function call, namely strings. Strings
are transmitted as a pointer/length pair, both as hex values, e.g.

```
1aaf/12
```

which is a pointer to data of length 18 bytes at position 0x1aaf.
The length is defined as the full string length in bytes, including
the trailing null byte. Example:

```
"hello, world" at address 0x123456
```

is transmitted as

```
123456/d
```

#### [struct stat](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztgq)

The buffer of type struct stat used by the target and GDB is defined
as follows:

```
struct stat {
    unsigned int  st_dev;      /* device */
    unsigned int  st_ino;      /* inode */
    mode_t        st_mode;     /* protection */
    unsigned int  st_nlink;    /* number of hard links */
    unsigned int  st_uid;      /* user ID of owner */
    unsigned int  st_gid;      /* group ID of owner */
    unsigned int  st_rdev;     /* device type (if inode device) */
    unsigned long st_size;     /* total size, in bytes */
    unsigned long st_blksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
    unsigned long st_blocks;   /* number of blocks allocated */
    time_t        st_atime;    /* time of last access */
    time_t        st_mtime;    /* time of last modification */
    time_t        st_ctime;    /* time of last change */
};
```

The integral datatypes are conforming to the definitions given in the
approriate section (see section [Integral datatypes](#apple-kncugmztgi), for details) so this
structure is of size 64 bytes.

The values of several fields have a restricted meaning and/or
range of values.

```
st_dev:     0       file
            1       console

st_ino:     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

st_mode:    Valid mode bits are described in Appendix C.  Any other
            bits have currently no meaning for the target.

st_uid:     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

st_gid:     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

st_rdev:    No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime:
            These values have a host and file system dependent
            accuracy.  Especially on Windows hosts the file systems
            don't support exact timing values.
```

The target gets a struct stat of the above representation and is
responsible to coerce it to the target representation before
continuing.

Note that due to size differences between the host and target
representation of stat members, these members could eventually
get truncated on the target.

#### [struct timeval](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztgu)

The buffer of type struct timeval used by the target and GDB
is defined as follows:

```
struct timeval {
    time_t tv_sec;  /* second */
    long   tv_usec; /* microsecond */
};
```

The integral datatypes are conforming to the definitions given in the
approriate section (see section [Integral datatypes](#apple-kncugmztgi), for details) so this
structure is of size 8 bytes.

### [Constants](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztgy)

The following values are used for the constants inside of the
protocol. GDB and target are resposible to translate these
values before and after the call as needed.

#### [Open flags](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmztg4)

### [File-I/O Examples](Debugging%20with%20GDB.md#apple-krhugmzugi)

Example sequence of a write call, file descriptor 3, buffer is at target
address 0x1234, 6 bytes should be written:

```swift
<- Fwrite,3,1234,6
request memory read from target
-> m1234,6
<- XXXXXX
return "6 bytes written"
-> F6
```

Example sequence of a read call, file descriptor 3, buffer is at target
address 0x1234, 6 bytes should be read:

```swift
<- Fread,3,1234,6
request memory write to target
-> X1234,6:XXXXXX
return "6 bytes read"
-> F6
```

Example sequence of a read call, call fails on the host due to invalid
file descriptor (EBADF):

```swift
<- Fread,3,1234,6
-> F-1,9
```

Example sequence of a read call, user presses Ctrl-C before syscall on
host is called:

```swift
<- Fread,3,1234,6
-> F-1,4,C
<- T02
```

Example sequence of a read call, user presses Ctrl-C after syscall on
host is called:

```swift
<- Fread,3,1234,6
-> X1234,6:XXXXXX
<- T02
```
