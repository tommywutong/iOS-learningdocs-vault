# AFP Replay Cache

If the server supports the replay cache, then in the `DSIOpenSession` reply packet from the server, there is a new option type of `kServerReplayCacheSize`. The _Option_ field length is 4 bytes, and the _Option_ value is the maximum number of DSI requests that the AFP server can cache in its replay cache. The client selects the smaller of its own maximum size or the server’s maximum size.

On the server side, the replay cache is the same size as the client’s replay cache so you can free the oldest DSI request when you receive a request with ID `size+1`.

For example, if the client and server's replay cache supports 5 DSI requests, if the client sends 5 requests with DSI request IDs of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the AFP Server caches replies for requests 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. When the next DSI request is sent by the AFP client, it has a DSI Request ID of 6. On the AFP server, when the request with ID 6 arrives, the server knows that the reply for DSI request ID 1 was successfully received by the AFP client. Thus, the reply for the request with ID 1 can now be freed. When the request with ID 7 is received by the AFP server, it frees the reply for the request with ID 2. The client will never send more requests than the maximum number of requests in the replay cache.

It is recommended that the replay cache be large enough to hold at least 32 requests, but strictly less than 65,536.

If the server includes a `kServerReplayCacheSize` option in the data portion of the `DSIOpenSession` reply packet, then it is assumed that the server supports the replay cache. If the replay cache is supported by the server, the client does not reset the _Request ID_ field to zero in the DSI header on reconnect. This persistent request ID allows the server to detect whether a request is a replayed request or a new request from the client.

The AFP server keeps a replay cache containing replies that it has sent. When a request arrives from the client, the server searches this cache looking for a matching DSI request ID. If a matching ID is found, the server compares the AFP command byte with the original request to make sure that they match. If the DSI request ID and AFP command byte match, the AFP Server sends the reply from the replay cache. If a match is not found in the cache, then the AFP Server should process it as a new request from the client.

With a replay AFP client, the DS request IDs are persistent which means they must not be reused unless the request is a replay of a previous request (meaning that the client never got the original reply, so it replays the request after a successful primary reconnect) or the ID has wrapped around back to that same number.

All AFP commands can be cached in the Replay cache if you want, but only a subset of the AFP commands are non-idempotent and must be cached. These commands are:

- FPByteRangeLock
- FPByteRangeLockExt
- FPChangePassword
- FPCloseFork
- FPCloseVol
- FPCopyFile
- FPCreateDir
- FPCreateFile
- FPDelete
- FPExchangeFiles
- FPFlush
- FPFlushFork
- FPRemoveExtendedAttr
- FPMoveAndRename
- FPOpenFork
- FPOpenVol
- FPRename
- FPSetDirParms
- FPSetFileDirParms
- FPSetFileParms
- FPSetForkParms
- FPSetVolParms
- FPSetExtendedAttr
- FPSetACL
- FPLink
- FPSyncDir
- FPSyncFork

The replay cache is useful _only_ if a Primary Reconnect is successful. If primary reconnect fails, then the replay cache was not found, and replay is not possible. In this case, any pending requests on the client in its replay cache are discarded and resent as new requests.

When the AFP client gets disconnected, it puts any still-outstanding requests on hold. After a successful primary reconnect, it replays those requests exactly as they had been sent out before.

DSI headers for AFP/TCP are described in [AFP Over TCP](AFP%20Over%20TCP.md#apple-f4xwc4dqnrsv64tfmyxwi33df52wszbpkridimbqgaydqnjufvbuqmrshawvgvzr).
