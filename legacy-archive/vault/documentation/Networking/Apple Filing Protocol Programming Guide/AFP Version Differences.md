# AFP Version Differences

This document as a whole describes the current version of the Apple Filing Protocol. This section provides a list of what commands were added in each AFP version.

For a complete description of the commands themselves, see _Apple Filing Protocol Reference_.

12 and 13 were missing from Inside AppleTalk and have never been allocated.

38-43 were missing from Inside AppleTalk but were added in AFP 2.1; presumably they were preallocated for System 7.0.

44-47 and 50 were missing from Inside AppleTalk and have never been allocated.

76 was added in AFP 3.2+, but will not be documented.

77 was used in prerelease versions of AFP 3.2+ but was discontinued before GM.

This version of the protocol is the version that was initially documented in _Inside AppleTalk_. The contents of _Inside AppleTalk_ are now split between this document and _Apple Filing Protocol Reference_.

This version was a significant upgrade to accommodate System 7.0.
