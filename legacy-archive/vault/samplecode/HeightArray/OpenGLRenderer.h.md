# OpenGLRenderer.h

```objc
/*
     File: OpenGLRenderer.h
 Abstract: The renderer class creates and draws the OpenGL shaders. Here we provide an example of two-dimensional texture array. It visualizes a terrain by using terrain's Z-coordinate to index into a texture array and applies the correct image for that point's elevation.
  Version: 1.3
