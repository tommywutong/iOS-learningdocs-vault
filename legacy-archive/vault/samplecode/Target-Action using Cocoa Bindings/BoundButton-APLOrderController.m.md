#pragma mark - Bound methods

/*
 The following method is bound using Cocoa's binding capabilities. To see how the methods are bound, look in MainMenu.xib.

 orderEntree:withToppings: is the method invoked by the "Place your order" button -- it is set up using bindings.

 The task is to "print out" to the text view the components and total price of the current order.

 The button's bindings are as follows:

 1) 'target' is bound to [APLOrderController].self -- this uses 'self' as a key simply to return the APLOrderController instance.

 The selector (specified in the 'target' binding) is orderEntree:withToppings:, identifying this method.

 2) 'argument' is a multi-value binding:

 'argument' is [Entrees].selection -- a proxy object representing the array controller's selection. This object is passed as the first argument to orderEntree:withToppings:. The method only sends the selected object (an entree dictionary) in the entrees table view.

 'argument2' is [Toppings].selectedObjects -- the objects currently selected in the toppings table view. This array is passed as the second argument to orderEntree:withToppings:.
 */

- (void)orderEntree:(id)selectedEntree withToppings:(NSArray *)selectedToppings {
    /*
     Check that there was an entree selection (the table view should disallow empty selections, but this is a useful example).
     */

        [self appendToTextView:NSLocalizedString(@"No Entree Selected", @"No entree selected.\n\n")];

        return;
    }

    // The total price starts with the price of the entree.
    float __block totalCost = [[selectedEntree valueForKey:kItemPriceKey] floatValue];


    // If there are no toppings, end here by adding just the plain entree to the order.
    if ([selectedToppings count] == 0) {
