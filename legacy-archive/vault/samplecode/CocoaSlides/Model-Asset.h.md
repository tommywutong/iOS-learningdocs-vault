/* An "Asset" is a file-granularity piece of media of some kind: an image, a movie, etc.  The API model presented here allows for every asset to provide a characteristic "preview image" that can be used to represent it in UI: a scaled-down version for an image, a poster frame image for a movie, etc.  CocoaSlides 1.0 only deals specifically with ImageAssets, but the basic characteristics shared by all assets have been split into the "Asset" base class to facilitate possible future extension to handle other kinds of assets such as movie files.
