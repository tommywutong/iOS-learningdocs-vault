| Technical Q&A HW13Developing a SCSI SIM for a PCI SCSI Controller |

|  |
| --- |
| ---   Q: I am developing a PCI SCSI controller card, and want to know if I need to write open firmware to have boot capabilities.  A: If you want your driver to be bootable across other operating systems, you should develop an Open Firmware driver. If you are only interested in running it on the MacOS, a SIM is all that is required. |
