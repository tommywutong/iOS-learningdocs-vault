| ---   Q: How do I create a Monitors control panel extension for a 9500 running 7.5.2? It obviously doesn't have a Slot Manager.  A: Use the Display Manager. It is described in _Designing PCI Cards and Drivers_, which is available on the DDK. There is also Display Manager documentation and samples in a separate folder on the DDK.  Basically, at initialization time the Display Manager queries drivers for their monitor capabilities and then creates the monitor extensions for the drivers. The advantage is the driver writer is no longer required to know about monitors. |
