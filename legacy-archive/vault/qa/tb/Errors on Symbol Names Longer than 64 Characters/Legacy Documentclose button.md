| Technical Q&A TB33Errors on Symbol Names Longer than 64 Characters |

| --- |
| Q FindSymbol returns a paramErr if I pass it a symbol name with a length greater than sixty-four characters, yet the documentation and interfaces specify that I pass the address of a Str255. What gives?   A This is a known bug that was fixed in System 7.5.5. You should either recommend to your customers that they upgrade to this version or keep your symbol name lengths to 64 characters or less.   [Jan 31 1997] |
