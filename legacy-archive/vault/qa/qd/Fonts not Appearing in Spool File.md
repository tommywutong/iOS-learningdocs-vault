| Technical Q&A QD10Fonts not Appearing in Spool File |

|  |
| --- |
| ---   Q: We have fonts in our application resource fork (knowing that the documentation advises against this). Theoretically, fonts are supposed to be stored in the LaserWriter's PS Spool file when printing in the background. Why can't we get these fonts to appear in the spool file?  A: LaserWriter 8.x.y does not spool fonts from applications (the LaserWriter 7.x drivers did). One workaround is to check for the presence of a LaserWriter 8.x driver, and install the special font into the spool file immediately after spooling. Updated: 1-July-95 |
