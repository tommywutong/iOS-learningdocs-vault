| Technical Q&A QD3D01Can't Turn Off DrawContext's clearImageMethod |

|  |
| --- |
|  Q: When we have the interactive renderer on, and we try to turn off the `DrawContext`'s `clearImageMethod` to `kQ3ClearMethodNone`, it still clears. This works properly with the wire-frame renderer, but we need this feature in the interactive renderer, as we are pasting in background pictures that we want to act as a backdrop to our 3D models, and the interactive renderer always obliterates the picture with the `clearImageColor`.  A: This is a renderer-dependent feature that is supported by the wire-frame renderer, but not the Interactive renderer. We intend to provide a "Clear with picture" method in the next major release of QuickDraw 3D. |
