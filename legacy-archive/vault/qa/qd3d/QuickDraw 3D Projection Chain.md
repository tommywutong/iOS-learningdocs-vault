| Technical Q&A QD3D06QuickDraw 3D Projection Chain |

|  |
| --- |
|  Q: The documentation states that the `Q3View_GetFrustrumToWindowMatrixState` can only be called between `StartRendering` and `EndRendering`. While this makes sense for the `Q3View_GetLocalToWorldMatrixState` routine, why should it apply to the others? We've set up a dummy rendering loop to call these routines, but it seems a waste. Also, the names for these routines seem wrong, since they get the matrix, not the state of the matrix.  A: The reason for the restriction is that, in future versions, we may provide the ability to transform the camera within the rendering loop. We chose to name them the way we did because you are getting the state [[`arrowhorizex`]] i.e., whatever the matrix is at the time. |
