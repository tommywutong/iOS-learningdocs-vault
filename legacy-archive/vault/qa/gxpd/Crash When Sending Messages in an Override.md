| Technical Q&A GXPD29Crash When Sending Messages in an Override |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ---  |  | | --- | | __Important for all Apple Printing and Graphics Developers:__   The information in this Technical Q & A is still relevant up to and including [Mac OS 7.6](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn/tn1090.html) with QuickDraw GX 1.1.5. Beginning with the release of Mac OS 8.0, however, Apple plans to deliver a system which incorporates QuickDraw GX graphics and typography __only__. QuickDraw GX printer drivers and GX printing extensions will __not__ be supported in Mac OS 8.0 or in future Mac OS releases. Apple's goal is to simplify the user experience of printing by unifying the Macintosh graphic and printing architectures and standardizing on the classic Printing Manager. For details on Apple's official announcement, refer to [</dev/technotes/gxchange.html>](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/gxchange.html) |     Q: I am trying to send messages from within a GX message override. I want to send `GXWriteData` to flush the buffer (__page 4-146, _Inside Mac: Printing Extensions and Drivers___) so that I can send the GXGetDeviceStatus message. I override the gxHandlePanelEvent message.  In my override, sending messages causes the system to crash so that the interrupt button does not summon MacsBug. What would cause this to happen?  A: The crash is occurring because there is no connection to the printer at the time you are sending the message. You have to send the `OpenConnection`, `WriteData`, and then `CloseConnection` messages. Note that when you call `OpenConnection`, QuickDraw GX puts up the default `JobStatus` dialog for a short time. If you don't want this dialog to appear, you can to override the GXJobStatus message to prevent it from being shown.  See also Dave Hersey's article, "Writing QuickDraw GX Driver with Custom I/O and Buffering," in [_develop 21_](https://developer.apple.com/dev/techsupport/develop/issue21toc.shtml). |
