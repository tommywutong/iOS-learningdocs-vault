| Technical Q&A PLAT05Auto-dependency Checker |

|  |
| --- |
| ---   Q: Is there an auto-dependency tool for MPW that will parse source files and create a tree of file dependencies (similar to the Watcom auto-dependency checker on the PC)?  A: There is a tool called MakeMake on the Tool Chest Edition of the Developer CD. MakeMake builds a makefile for the specified targets from a list of source files and assorted options. The generated makefile contains productions for each target, full dependencies for included files, and a set of "convenience targets" for such tasks as removing object files and printing source listings.  The CD also includes a MacWrite document entitled, "MakeMake Manual (MacWrite)," which explains the tool's syntax and provides some examples.  MakeMake and a number of other useful MPW tools are on the Tool Chest CD Developer CD in the following path:  Developer CD  Tool Chest  Development Tools & Languages  MPW Related  MakeMake 2.0d38. |
