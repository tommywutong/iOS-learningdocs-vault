| Technical Q&A ME03Determining the State of the Modern Memory Manager |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Q: How do I determine if I am running with the Modern Memory Manager?  A: You can tell the state of MMM based on the heapType member in your current Zone. The following function shows how this is done:   |  | | --- | | ``` #include <Memory.h>  /* ** HaveNewMemoryManager returns true if the new ** Memory Manager is present */  Boolean HaveNewMemoryManager ( void ) {     THz appZone;      appZone = GetZone ();     return ((appZone->heapType & kNewStyleHeap) != 0); } ``` |     [Jul 06 1996] |
