| Technical Q&A NW37OTScheduleSystemTask Cleanup |

|  |
| --- |
| ---   Q: I'm scheduling a task to run at non-interrupt time using `OTScheduleSystemTask`. Will this be automatically cleaned up when I call `CloseOpenTransport`?  A: No. You must explicitly clean up any pending system tasks using `OTDestroySystemTask`. |
