# location

<sub>Type Property</sub>

A key indicating that the app was launched to handle an incoming location event.

> [!warning] Deprecated
> Adopt CLLocationUpdate or CLMonitor, or use CLLocationManagerDelegate from CoreLocation to handle expected location events after scene connection.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
static let location: UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey
```

## Discussion

The value of this key is an [NSNumber](../../../foundation/nsnumber.md) object containing a Boolean value. You should use the presence of this key as a signal to create a [CLLocationManager](../../../corelocation/cllocationmanager.md) object and start location services again. Location data is delivered only to the location manager delegate and not using this key.
