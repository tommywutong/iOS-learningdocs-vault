# url

<sub>Type Property</sub>

A key indicating that the app was launched so that it could open the specified URL.

> [!warning] Deprecated
> Use UIScene lifecycle and UIScene.ConnectionOptions.URLContexts instead.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
static let url: UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey
```

## Discussion

The value of this key is an [NSURL](../../../foundation/nsurl.md) object containing the URL to open. This key is also used to access the same value in the `userInfo` dictionary of the notification named [UIApplicationDidFinishLaunchingNotification](../didfinishlaunchingnotification.md).
