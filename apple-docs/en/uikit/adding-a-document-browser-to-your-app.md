# Adding a document browser to your app

Give people access to their local or remote documents from within your app.

## Overview

When your app’s main purpose is browsing and working with documents, use a document browser view controller as the root of your app’s view hierarchy. When someone selects a document, you present its view controller modally from your document browser.

> [!important] Important
> Always assign [UIDocumentBrowserViewController](uidocumentbrowserviewcontroller.md) as your app’s root view controller. UIKit doesn’t support placing the document browser in a navigation controller, tab bar, split view, or modal presentation.
>
> If you want to present a document browser from another location in your view hierarchy, use a [UIDocumentPickerViewController](uidocumentpickerviewcontroller.md) instead.

The browser automatically gives people the option to share documents using the Share button or a drag-and-drop action. It also provides a standard interface for browsing and managing documents.

You set the type of documents that someone can select when the browser is first created. You can also set the browser’s appearance, modify its behaviors, and add custom actions.
