# Focus-based navigation

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Navigate the interface of your UIKit app using a remote, game controller, or keyboard.

- [UIFocusEnvironment](uifocusenvironment.md) — A set of methods that define the focus behavior for a branch of the view hierarchy.
- [UIFocusSystem](uifocussystem.md) — Queries and reevaluates the currently focused item.
- [UIFocusUpdateContext](uifocusupdatecontext.md) — An object that provides information relevant to a specific focus update from one view to another.
- [UIFocusItem](uifocusitem.md) — An object that can become focused.
- [UIFocusMovementHint](uifocusmovementhint.md) — Provides movement hint information for the focused item.
- [UIFocusItemContainer](uifocusitemcontainer.md) — The container responsible for providing geometric context to focus items within a given focus environment.
- [UIFocusItemScrollableContainer](uifocusitemscrollablecontainer.md) — A type of focus item container that supports automatic scrolling of focusable content.
- [UIFocusGroupPriority](uifocusgrouppriority.md) — The importance of an item within a focus group, used by the focus system to determine the group’s primary item.
