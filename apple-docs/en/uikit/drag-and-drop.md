# Drag and drop

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Bring drag and drop to your app by using interaction APIs with your views.

## Overview

With drag and drop in iOS, users can drag items from one onscreen location to another using continuous gestures. A drag-and-drop activity can take place in a single app, or it can start in one app and end in another.

> [!note] Note
> Prior to iOS 15, drag-and-drop activities on iPhone can take place in a single app but not between two apps.

The app from which an item is dragged is the _source app_. The app on which an item is dropped is the _destination app_. For drag and drop in a single app, that app plays both roles simultaneously. The complete user action from start to finish — using system-mediated gestures — is a _drag activity_. A _drag session_, by contrast, is an object that’s managed by the system and that manages the items the user is dragging.

When dragging is in progress, the source and destination apps continue to run normally and support user interaction. A user can invoke the Dock, return to the Home screen, open a second app in Split View, and even start another drag activity.

Unlike in macOS, iOS drag and drop supports multiple simultaneous drag activities—as many as the user’s fingers can handle. You can design your app so that the user can sequentially add drag items to an in-progress drag session, and a destination app can accept multiple, simultaneous drops.

Text views and text fields automatically support drag and drop. Collection views and table views offer dedicated, view-specific methods and properties, and text views offer APIs for customizing the views’ drag-and-drop behavior. You can configure any custom view to support drag and drop.

> [!note] Note
> The system handles all security aspects of inter-app drag and drop in iOS. You don’t need to perform additional configuration like setting special entitlements or `Info.plist` keys.
