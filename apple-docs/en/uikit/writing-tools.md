# Writing Tools

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Add support for Writing Tools to your app’s text views.

## Overview

Writing Tools provides a simple way for people to improve what they write using your app. Text views that support Writing Tools gain the ability to proofread, rewrite, summarize, or compose content with the help of system-provided large language models (LLMs) and Apple Intelligence.

Writing Tools supports both the standard system views and custom text views you create. The [UITextView](uitextview.md) and [UITextField](uitextfield.md) classes automatically support Writing Tools, but you can customize that support to suit your app’s requirements. You can also add Writing Tools support to any [UIView](uiview.md) in your app that contains text.

## Topics

### Configuration

- [Customizing Writing Tools behavior for UIKit views](customizing-writing-tools-behavior-for-system-views.md) — Modify the behavior of Writing Tools in standard iOS text views, and adjust your app’s behavior while the feature is active.

- [UIWritingToolsResultOptions](uiwritingtoolsresultoptions.md) — Constants to specify what type of content to allow in Writing Tools suggestions or rewrites.

### Writing Tools for custom views

- [Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view](adding-writing-tools-support-to-a-custom-uiview.md) — Add Writing Tools support, including support for inline replacement animations, to your custom iOS views that contain text.
- [UIWritingToolsCoordinator](uiwritingtoolscoordinator.md) — An object that manages interactions between Writing Tools and your custom text view.
- [Delegate](uiwritingtoolscoordinator/delegate-swift.protocol.md) — An interface that you use to manage interactions between Writing Tools and your custom text view.
- [Context](uiwritingtoolscoordinator/context.md) — A data object that you use to share your custom view’s text with Writing Tools.
- [AnimationParameters](uiwritingtoolscoordinator/animationparameters.md) — An object you use to configure additional tasks or animations to run alongside the Writing Tools animations.

### Text previews

- [UITargetedPreview](uitargetedpreview.md) — An object describing the view to use during preview-related animations.
