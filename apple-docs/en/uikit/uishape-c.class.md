# UIShape

<sub>Class</sub>

An abstract representation of a shape.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
@interface UIShape : NSObject
```

## Overview

A [UIShape](uishape-swift.struct.md) can represent different types of shapes, including:

- A simple shape like a rectangle or circle that resolves into a concrete shape according to context (like size and position)
- A Bézier path
- A dynamic shape that resolves using a custom closure

You typically use a [UIShape](uishape-swift.struct.md) with APIs like [UIHoverStyle](uihoverstyle.md) to represent the shape of an effect.

## Relationships

- **Inherits From**: [NSObject](../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class.md)

- **Conforms To**: [NSCopying](../foundation/nscopying.md), [UIShapeProvider](uishapeprovider-31jrf.md)

## Topics

### Creating a hover shape

- [rectShape](uishape-c.class/rectshape.md) — Creates a rectangular shape.
- [capsuleShape](uishape-c.class/capsuleshape.md) — Creates a capsule shape, a rounded rectangle with a corner radius equal to half the length of the rectangle’s smallest edge.
- [circleShape](uishape-c.class/circleshape.md) — Creates a circular shape, with a radius equal to half the length of the frame rectangle’s smallest edge.
- [rectShapeWithCornerRadius:](uishape-c.class/rectshapewithcornerradius_.md) — Creates a rectangular shape with rounded corners, using the provided corner radius.
- [rectShapeWithCornerRadius:cornerCurve:](uishape-c.class/rectshapewithcornerradius_cornercurve_.md) — Creates a rectangular shape with rounded corners, using the provided corner radius and corner curve.
- [rectShapeWithCornerRadius:cornerCurve:maskedCorners:](uishape-c.class/rectshapewithcornerradius_cornercurve_maskedcorners_.md) — Creates a rectangular shape with rounded corners, using the provided corner radius, corner curve, and rectangle corners.
- [fixedRectShapeWithRect:](uishape-c.class/fixedrectshapewithrect_.md) — Creates a fixed rectangular shape that uses the provided rectangle as its shape, regardless of the frame that contains it.
- [fixedRectShapeWithRect:cornerRadius:](uishape-c.class/fixedrectshapewithrect_cornerradius_.md) — Creates a fixed rectangular shape with the provided corner radius, using the provided rectangle as its shape.
- [fixedRectShapeWithRect:cornerRadius:cornerCurve:maskedCorners:](uishape-c.class/fixedrectshapewithrect_cornerradius_cornercurve_maskedcorners_.md) — Creates a fixed rectangular shape with the provided corner radius and corner curve, using the provided rectangle as its shape.
- [UICornerCurve](uicornercurve.md) — The corner curve to apply to a view.

### Creating a hover shape from a custom path

- [shapeWithBezierPath:](uishape-c.class/shapewithbezierpath_.md) — Creates a shape with a custom Bézier path.

### Creating a dynamic hover shape

- [shapeWithProvider:](uishape-c.class/shapewithprovider_.md) — Creates a dynamic shape that resolves using the provided resolver closure and resolution context.
- [UIShapeProvider](uishapeprovider-31jrf.md) — An interface for a type that provides a custom shape by resolving it dynamically based on a context.
- [resolvedShapeInContext:](uishape-c.class/resolvedshapeincontext_.md) — Resolves the shape in the provided context.
- [UIShapeResolutionContext](uishaperesolutioncontext.md) — The context for resolving a dynamic shape.
- [UIResolvedShape](uiresolvedshape.md) — A shape that has completely resolved based on a context.

### Creating a shape by applying insets

- [shapeByApplyingInsets:](uishape-c.class/shapebyapplyinginsets_.md) — Creates a new modified shape by applying the provided insets to this shape.
- [shapeByApplyingInset:](uishape-c.class/shapebyapplyinginset_.md) — Creates a new modified shape by applying the provided inset to this shape.
