# shouldBeRequiredToFail(by:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Overridden to indicate that the receiver should be required to fail by the specified gesture recognizer.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
func shouldBeRequiredToFail(by otherGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `otherGestureRecognizer` — An instance of a subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`.

## Return Value

[true](../../swift/true.md) to set up the failure requirement; otherwise, [false](../../swift/false.md).

## Discussion

Overriding this method allows a subclass to define a class-wide failure requirement.

### Implementing subclasses

- [- touchesBegan:withEvent:](<touchesbegan(__with_).md>) — Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers touch down in the associated view.
- [- touchesMoved:withEvent:](<touchesmoved(__with_).md>) — Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers move in the associated view.
- [- touchesEnded:withEvent:](<touchesended(__with_).md>) — Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers lift from the associated view.
- [- touchesCancelled:withEvent:](<touchescancelled(__with_).md>) — Sent to the gesture recognizer when a system event (such as an incoming phone call) cancels a touch event.
- [- touchesEstimatedPropertiesUpdated:](<touchesestimatedpropertiesupdated(__).md>) — Sent to the gesture recognizer when the estimated properties for a touch have changed so that they are no longer estimated, or an update is no longer expected.
- [- reset](<reset().md>) — Overridden to reset internal state when a gesture recognition attempt completes.
- [- ignoreTouch:forEvent:](<ignore(__for_)-5f685.md>) — Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific touch of the given event.
- [- canBePreventedByGestureRecognizer:](<canbeprevented(by_).md>) — Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the receiver from recognizing a gesture.
- [- canPreventGestureRecognizer:](<canprevent(__).md>) — Overridden to indicate that the receiver can prevent the specified gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture.
- [- shouldReceiveEvent:](<shouldreceive(__).md>)
- [- shouldRequireFailureOfGestureRecognizer:](<shouldrequirefailure(of_).md>) — Overridden to indicate that the receiver requires the specified gesture recognizer to fail.
- [- ignorePress:forEvent:](<ignore(__for_)-8qqor.md>) — Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific press of the given event.
- [- pressesBegan:withEvent:](<pressesbegan(__with_).md>) — Sent to the receiver when a physical button is pressed in the associated view.
- [- pressesChanged:withEvent:](<presseschanged(__with_).md>) — Sent to the receiver when the [force](../uipress/force.md) of the press has changed in the associated view.
- [- pressesEnded:withEvent:](<pressesended(__with_).md>) — Sent to the receiver when a button is released from the associated view.
