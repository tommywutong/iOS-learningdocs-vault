# UIPushBehavior

<sub>Class</sub>

A behavior that applies a continuous or instantaneous force to one or more dynamic items, causing those items to change position accordingly.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
@MainActor class UIPushBehavior
```

## Overview

A _dynamic item_ is any iOS or custom object that conforms to the [UIDynamicItem](uidynamicitem.md) protocol. The [UIView](uiview.md) and [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes](uicollectionviewlayoutattributes.md) classes implement this protocol starting in iOS 7.0. You can use a custom object as a dynamic item for such purposes as reacting to rotation or position changes computed by a dynamic animator—an instance of the [UIDynamicAnimator](uidynamicanimator.md) class.

The default magnitude of a push behavior’s force vector is `nil`, equivalent to no force. A continuous force vector with a magnitude of `1.0`, applied to a 100 point x 100 point view whose density value is `1.0`, results in view acceleration of 100 points / second² in the direction of the vector; this value is also known as the UIKit Newton.

You express a push behavior’s force vector in terms of magnitude ([magnitude](uipushbehavior/magnitude.md)) and radian angle ([angle](uipushbehavior/angle.md)). Instead of using radian angle, you can equivalently express direction using _x_ and _y_ components by using the [pushDirection](uipushbehavior/pushdirection.md) property. Whichever approach you use, the alternate, equivalent values update automatically.

For each dynamic item that you associate with a push, the force is applied at the item center or at a specified offset from the center in item-relative coordinates.

To use a push behavior with a dynamic item, perform these two steps:

1. Associate the item with the behavior using the [- addItem:](<uipushbehavior/additem(__).md>) method, or initialize a new push behavior with an array of items using the [- initWithItems:mode:](<uipushbehavior/init(items_mode_).md>) method
2. Enable the behavior by adding it to an animator using the [- addBehavior:](<uidynamicanimator/addbehavior(__).md>) method

After enabling a push behavior, you can activate it and deactivate it using the [active](uipushbehavior/active.md) property.

The coordinate system that pertains to a push behavior, and the types of dynamic items you can use with the behavior, depend on how you initialized the associated animator. For details, read the Overview of [UIDynamicAnimator](uidynamicanimator.md).

You can include a push behavior in a custom, composite behavior by starting with a [UIDynamicBehavior](uidynamicbehavior.md) object and adding a push behavior with the [- addChildBehavior:](<uidynamicbehavior/addchildbehavior(__).md>) method.  If you want to influence a push behavior at each step of a dynamic animation, implement the inherited [action](uidynamicbehavior/action.md) method.

## Topics

### Initializing and managing a push behavior

- [active](uipushbehavior/active.md) — The state of the push behavior’s force: either active or inactive.
- [- addItem:](<uipushbehavior/additem(__).md>) — Adds a dynamic item to the behavior’s dynamic item array.
- [- initWithItems:mode:](<uipushbehavior/init(items_mode_).md>) — Initializes a push behavior with an array of dynamic items.
- [- removeItem:](<uipushbehavior/removeitem(__).md>) — Removes a specific dynamic item from the behavior.
- [items](uipushbehavior/items.md) — Returns the set of dynamic items you’ve added to the push behavior.

### Configuring a push behavior

- [- setAngle:magnitude:](<uipushbehavior/setangle(__magnitude_).md>) — Sets the angle and magnitude of the force vector for the behavior.
- [angle](uipushbehavior/angle.md) — The angle, in radians, of the force vector for the behavior.
- [magnitude](uipushbehavior/magnitude.md) — The magnitude of the force vector for the push behavior.
- [mode](uipushbehavior/mode-swift.property.md) — Returns the force mode for the push behavior.
- [- setTargetOffsetFromCenter:forItem:](<uipushbehavior/settargetoffsetfromcenter(__for_).md>) — Sets the offset, from the center of a dynamic item, at which to apply the push behavior’s force vector.
- [- targetOffsetFromCenterForItem:](<uipushbehavior/targetoffsetfromcenter(for_).md>) — Returns the offset, from the center of a dynamic item, at which the push behavior’s force vector is applied.
- [pushDirection](uipushbehavior/pushdirection.md) — The direction of the force vector for the behavior, expressed as _x_ and _y_ components and using standard UIKit geometry.

### Constants

- [Mode](uipushbehavior/mode-swift.enum.md) — The type of force for the push behavior.
