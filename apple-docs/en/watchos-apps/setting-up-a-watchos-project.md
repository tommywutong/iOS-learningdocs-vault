# Setting up a watchOS project

Create a new watchOS project or add a watch target to an existing iOS project.

## Overview

Before you start a new watchOS project, you need to decide how you’re going to distribute that project: as a watch-only app or as a watchOS app with an iOS app. If your app is only available on Apple Watch, create a new watch-only project. If you want both a watchOS and an iOS app that deliver related experiences, either create a new watchOS app with a companion iOS app or add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project.

### Create a new watchOS project

To create a new watchOS project:

1. In Xcode, choose File \> New \> Project.
2. Select the watchOS tab.
3. Select the App icon and click Next.
4. In the project options sheet, enter a name for the project. To create a watch-only app, select “Watch-only App.” To create both a watchOS app and an iOS app, select “Watch App with New Companion iOS App.” Then click Next.
5. Select a location for the project and click Create.

### Add a watchOS target to an existing iOS app

To add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project:

1. Select the project in the Project navigator.
2. Click the “Add a target” button in the Project editor.
3. Select the watchOS tab.
4. Select the App icon and click Next.
5. In the project option sheet, enter a name for the watchOS app, and select “Watch app for Existing iOS App.” Make sure to select the correct iOS app in the pull-down menu, and click Finish.
