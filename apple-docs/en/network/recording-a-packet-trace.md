# Recording a Packet Trace

Learn how to record a low-level trace of network traffic.

## Overview

A packet trace is a record of traffic traveling across the network. It’s useful for investigating complex network problems related to both correctness and performance.

Once you start a packet trace on a network interface, it records all traffic passing through that interface until you stop the trace. Packet traces are usually quite short — perhaps recording the traffic associated with one specific connection — but there are situations where you might want to run the trace for hours or even days.

Both macOS and iOS have built-in support for packet traces. This article explains how to record a packet trace on both platforms. Even if your primary focus is iOS, you should start by running some tests on macOS to familiarize yourself with the tools before you attempt to debug your actual problem.

> [!note] Note
> Packet traces are a low-level feature and, if you’re just getting started, you may be better off using one of the higher-level tools referenced in [Choosing a Network Debugging Tool](choosing-a-network-debugging-tool.md). Additionally, while the focus of this article is the built-in packet trace tools, there are a variety of third-party packet trace tools that you might want to investigate; see [Taking Advantage of Third-Party Network Debugging Tools](taking-advantage-of-third-party-network-debugging-tools.md) for details.

### Choose the Correct Interface

The first step in recording a packet trace on the Mac is to choose the correct interface. If you choose the wrong interface, you may end up recording an empty packet trace. For example, if you use the `en0` interface on a Mac that has built-in Ethernet but is connected to the Internet over Wi-Fi, your packet trace will include all the traffic over the built-in Ethernet, that is, nothing.

Determine the correct interface name by running the `networksetup` command-line tool with the `-listallhardwareports` argument. This prints a list of network interfaces, including both the user-visible name and the short interface name needed by packet trace tools. For example:

```shell
$ networksetup -listallhardwareports

Hardware Port: Ethernet
Device: en0
Ethernet Address: 54:45:5b:01:ca:89

Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en1
Ethernet Address: 78:a1:3c:02:2b:da

… and so on …
```

In this example, the built-in Ethernet is `en0` and the built-in Wi-Fi is `en1`, but this will change from machine to machine. Look through this list for the user-visible name of the interface you want to trace (these match the names shown in Network preferences), then use the associated short interface name.

### Record and Analyze a Packet Trace on a Mac

Working with packet traces usually involves recording a packet trace to a file and analyzing that file. It’s possible to do both steps at once, and it’s a good idea to do that when you’re just getting started. The following Terminal command starts a packet trace and prints information about each packet as it’s transferred.

```shell
sudo tcpdump -i en0 -n
```

In this example:

- `tcpdump` is the name of macOS’s built-in packet trace tool.
- The `sudo` command causes `tcpdump` to run with privileges, which is necessary in order to record packets.
- The `-i en0` option tells `tcpdump` to record packets on the default Ethernet-like interface. Replace `en0` with the short interface name you determined in [Choose the Correct Interface](recording-a-packet-trace.md#Choose-the-Correct-Interface).
- The `-n` option tells tcpdump not to attempt to use reverse DNS to map IP addresses to names; such mapping is rarely useful on the modern Internet and it radically slows things down.

When you run `tcpdump` in this way, you see something like this:

```shell
17:49:26.500970 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [S], seq 3769365868, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 1478872373 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0
17:49:26.503325 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [S.], seq 405178393, ack 3769365869, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 72353448 ecr 1478872373,sackOK,eol], length 0
17:49:26.503413 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 1478872375 ecr 72353448], length 0
17:49:26.504887 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 72353449 ecr 1478872375], length 0
17:49:26.526134 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [P.], seq 1:22, ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 72353470 ecr 1478872375], length 21
17:49:26.526228 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [.], ack 22, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 1478872396 ecr 72353470], length 0
```

There’s a line of output for each packet seen on the network. On each line there’s a timestamp and a lot of information about that packet. This specific example shows the start of a connection from an SSH client at 192.168.1.187 to an SSH server listening on port 22 of 192.168.1.39.

Packet traces can be quite overwhelming. Rather than trying to interpret the packet trace in real time, use the `-w` option to write the trace to a file and then do your analysis later on.

```shell
sudo tcpdump -i en0 -w trace.pcap
```

This example records a packet trace and writes the results to a file call `trace.pcap`. You can save that file to analyze later on using `tcpdump` itself, or one of the tools listed in [Taking Advantage of Third-Party Network Debugging Tools](taking-advantage-of-third-party-network-debugging-tools.md). You can also submit it to Apple for analysis (see [Submitting a Packet Trace to Apple](submitting-a-packet-trace-to-apple.md)).

> [!important] Important
> Even if your ultimate goal is to save a packet trace file, it’s often a good idea to start out by looking at real-time results from `tcpdump`, just to make sure that you’re capturing the right thing.

If you’re having problems recording a packet trace, see [Troubleshooting Packet Traces](troubleshooting-packet-traces.md).

### Set Up iOS Packet Tracing

iOS doesn’t let you record a packet trace directly. However, you can use your Mac to record a packet trace on an attached iOS device using the Remote Virtual Interface (RVI) mechanism. To get started, first connect your iOS device to your Mac via USB. Next run the `rvictl` command in Terminal.

```shell
rvictl -s b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1
```

In this example:

- `rvictl` is the name of the command that manipulates RVIs.
- `-s` tells `rvictl` to set up a new RVI.
- `b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1` is the UDID of the iOS device to target. This UDID is just an example; you can find your device’s UDID in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode.

This command prints the following output.

```shell
$ rvictl -s b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1

Starting device b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1 [SUCCEEDED] with interface rvi0
```

This output includes the interface name of the newly-created RVI, `rvi0` in this example. Supply this interface name to your favorite packet trace tool to record a trace of the traffic on your iOS device. For example, use the following command to record a packet trace on `rvi0` and write it to `trace.pcap`.

```shell
sudo tcpdump -i rvi0 -w trace.pcap
```

If you’re having problems working with RVIs, see [Troubleshooting Packet Traces](troubleshooting-packet-traces.md) for some troubleshooting tips.

### Display and Filter iOS Interface Information

An RVI represents the entire networking stack of the iOS device; you cannot target a specific interface on the device as you would on the Mac. However, information about the interface is recorded in the packet metadata. You can use your packet trace tool to display the interface for each packet and filter the trace based on that interface. For the `tcpdump` tool, use the -k option to display packet metadata and tcpdump -Q to filter on it. The `tcpdump` man page has the details; see [Reading UNIX Manual Pages](../os/reading-unix-manual-pages.md).
