# NSGlyphInscription

<sub>Enumeration</sub>

Constants that specify how a glyph is laid out relative to the previous glyph.

> [!warning] Deprecated
> Use [GlyphProperty](nslayoutmanager/glyphproperty.md) instead.

<sub>macOS</sub>

```objc
enum NSGlyphInscription : NSUInteger;
```

## Overview

The glyph inscription constants are possible values for the glyph attribute [NSGlyphAttributeInscribe](nsglyphattributeinscribe.md); glyph inscriptions are set during glyph generation. The only constants that the text system currently uses are `NSGlyphInscribeBase` (for most glyphs) and `NSGlyphInscribeOverstrike` (for nonbase glyphs). Nonbase glyphs occur when diacritical marks are applied to a base character, and the font does not have a single glyph to represent the combination.

For example, if a font did not contain a single glyph for ü, but did contain separate glyphs for u and ¨, then it could be rendered with a base glyph u followed by a nonbase glyph ¨. In that case the nonbase glyph would have the value `NSGlyphInscribeOverstrike` for the inscribe attribute.

## Topics

### Constants

- [NSGlyphInscribeBase](nsglyphinscription/nsglyphinscribebase.md) — A base glyph; a character that the font can represent with a single glyph. _(deprecated)_
- [NSGlyphInscribeBelow](nsglyphinscription/nsglyphinscribebelow.md) — A glyph is rendered below the previous glyph. _(deprecated)_
- [NSGlyphInscribeAbove](nsglyphinscription/nsglyphinscribeabove.md) — A glyph is rendered above the previous glyph. _(deprecated)_
- [NSGlyphInscribeOverstrike](nsglyphinscription/nsglyphinscribeoverstrike.md) — A glyph is rendered on top of the previous glyph. _(deprecated)_
- [NSGlyphInscribeOverBelow](nsglyphinscription/nsglyphinscribeoverbelow.md) — A glyph is rendered on top and below the previous glyph. _(deprecated)_
