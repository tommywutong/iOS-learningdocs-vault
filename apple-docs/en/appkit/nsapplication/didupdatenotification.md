# didUpdateNotification

<sub>Type Property</sub>

Posted at the end of the [- updateWindows](<updatewindows().md>) method to indicate that the app has finished updating its windows.

<sub>macOS</sub>

```swift
class let didUpdateNotification: NSNotification.Name
```

## Discussion

The notification object is `NSApp`. This notification doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary.  The system posts this notification on the main actor.

To observe this notification using Swift concurrency, use [DidUpdateWindowsMessage](didupdatewindowsmessage.md).
