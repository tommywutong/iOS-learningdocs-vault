# isLocalToneMapSupported

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

A Boolean that indicates if the current image supports local tone curve adjustments.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
var isLocalToneMapSupported: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

If this value is `true`, you can adjust the amount of local tone curve to apply to the image by setting [localToneMapAmount](localtonemapamount.md).
