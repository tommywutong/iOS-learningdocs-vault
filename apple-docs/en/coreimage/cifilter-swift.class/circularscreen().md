# circularScreen()

<sub>Type Method</sub>

Adds a circular overlay to an image.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
class func circularScreen() -> any CIFilter & CICircularScreen
```

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies a circular screen filter to an image. The effect generates a monochrome image containing a series of circular rings. The halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. Print media commonly uses this effect.

The circular screen filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`** — An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`center`** — A set of coordinates marking the center of the image as a [CGPoint](../../corefoundation/cgpoint.md).
- **`width`** — A `float` representing the distance between each circle in the pattern as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`sharpness`** — A `float` representing the sharpness of the circles in the pattern as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in a monochrome image with a large circular pattern overlaying the image:

```swift
func circular(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let circularHalftone = CIFilter.circularScreen()
    circularHalftone.inputImage = inputImage
    circularHalftone.center = CGPoint(x: 2016, y: 1512)
    circularHalftone.width = 35
    circularHalftone.sharpness = 0.70
    return circularHalftone.outputImage!
}
```

In the photo on the right, a circular screen filter is applied, resulting in the image becoming monochrome with an overlay of circular lines radiating from the center of the image out to the periphery.</sub>
