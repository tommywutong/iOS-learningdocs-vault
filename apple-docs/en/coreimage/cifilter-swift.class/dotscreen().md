# dotScreen()

<sub>Type Method</sub>

Creates a monochrome image with a series of dots to add detail.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
class func dotScreen() -> any CIFilter & CIDotScreen
```

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies a dot screen filter to an image. The effect generates a monochrome image containing a series of dots creating detail. The halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. Print media commonly uses this effect.

The dot screen filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`** — An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`center`** — A set of coordinates marking the center of the image as a [CGPoint](../../corefoundation/cgpoint.md).
- **`width`** — A `float` representing the distance between dots in the pattern as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`sharpness`** — A `float` representing the sharpness of the pattern as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).

The following code creates a filter that produces an image containing monochrome dots of detail on a black background:

```swift
func dot (inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let dotScreen = CIFilter.dotScreen()
    dotScreen.inputImage = inputImage
    dotScreen.angle = 0
    dotScreen.center = CGPoint(x: 2016, y: 1512)
    dotScreen.width = 35
    dotScreen.sharpness = 0.7
    return dotScreen.outputImage!
}
```

In the photo on the right, a dot screen filter is applied, resulting in the image becoming monochrome with an overlay of small dots creating the detail of the image.</sub>
