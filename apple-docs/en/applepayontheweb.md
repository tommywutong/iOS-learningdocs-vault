# Apple Pay on the Web

<sub>Technology</sub>

Support Apple Pay on your website with JavaScript-based APIs.

## Overview

Safari supports two JavaScript APIs that let you accept Apple Pay payments from customers on your website:

- [Payment Request API](applepayontheweb/payment-request-api.md), a [W3C candidate API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/)
- [Apple Pay JS API](applepayontheweb/apple-pay-js-api.md), analogous to the [PassKit (Apple Pay and Wallet)](passkit.md) framework for Apple Pay in apps

> [!tip] Tip
> You can try out Apple Pay transactions on the demo page. See [Apple Pay on the Web Interactive Demo](https://applepaydemo.apple.com).

Apple Pay is available on all iOS devices with a Secure Element — an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store payment information safely. In macOS, to authorize the payment, users need a Mac with Touch ID, or an Apple Pay-capable iPhone or Apple Watch..

### Apple Pay availability by region and platform

Apple Pay is available in [supported regions](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#apple-pay).

The Apple Pay APIs are available in Safari on the following platforms:

|  | **Worldwide (except China)** | **China** |
|---|---|---|
| **Apple Pay JS** | iOS 10 and later ![](../../attachments/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) macOS 10.12 and later | iOS 11.2 and later ![](../../attachments/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) (Not available in macOS) |
| **Payment Request API** | iOS 11.3 and later ![](../../attachments/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) macOS 10.12.6 and later, in Safari 11.1 and later | iOS 11.3 and later ![](../../attachments/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) (Not available in macOS) |

In iOS, Safari and [SFSafariViewController](safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller.md) objects support Apple Pay.

See [Checking for Apple Pay availability](applepayontheweb/checking-for-apple-pay-availability.md) to ensure your implementation only displays the Apple Pay button on supported devices.

> [!note] Note
> Regulations in some regions may require specific configurations in your implementation. For more information, see [Complying with regional regulations](passkit/complying-with-regional-regulations.md).
