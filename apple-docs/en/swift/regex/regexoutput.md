## Discussion

A `Regex` instance’s output type depends on whether the `Regex` has captures and how it is created.

- A `Regex` created from a string using the `init(_:)` initializer has an output type of [AnyRegexOutput](../anyregexoutput.md), whether it has captures or not.
- A `Regex` without captures created from a regex literal, the `init(_:as:)` initializer, or a `RegexBuilder` closure has a `Substring` output type, where the substring is the portion of the string that was matched.
- A `Regex` with captures created from a regex literal or the `init(_:as:)` initializer has a tuple of substrings as its output type. The first component of the tuple is the full portion of the string that was matched, with the remaining components holding the captures.
