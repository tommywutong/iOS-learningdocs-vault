# split(maxSplits:omittingEmptySubsequences:whereSeparator:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func split(maxSplits: Int = Int.max, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool = true, whereSeparator isSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.SubSequence]
```

## Parameters

- `maxSplits` — The maximum number of times to split the collection, or one less than the number of subsequences to return. If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original collection containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.

- `omittingEmptySubsequences` — If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each pair of consecutive elements satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate and for each element at the start or end of the collection satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate. The default value is `true`.

- `isSeparator` — A closure that takes an element as an argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the collection should be split at that element.

## Return Value

An array of subsequences, split from this collection’s elements.

## Discussion

The resulting array consists of at most `maxSplits + 1` subsequences. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.

The following examples show the effects of the `maxSplits` and `omittingEmptySubsequences` parameters when splitting a string using a closure that matches spaces. The first use of `split` returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.

```swift
let line = "BLANCHE:   I don't want realism. I want magic!"
print(line.split(whereSeparator: { $0 == " " }))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
```

The second example passes `1` for the `maxSplits` parameter, so the original string is split just once, into two new strings.

```swift
print(line.split(maxSplits: 1, whereSeparator: { $0 == " " }))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "  I don\'t want realism. I want magic!"]"
```

The final example passes `false` for the `omittingEmptySubsequences` parameter, so the returned array contains empty strings where spaces were repeated.

```swift
print(line.split(omittingEmptySubsequences: false, whereSeparator: { $0 == " " }))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "", "", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
```
