# Imported C and Objective-C APIs

Use native Swift syntax to interoperate with types and functions in C and Objective-C.

## Overview

You can access and use pieces of code written in C and Objective-C from within your Swift code. After you import an Objective-C framework, a C library, or a header file, you can work with Objective-C classes and protocols, as well as common C constructs, functions, and patterns.

## Topics

### Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project

- [Importing Objective-C into Swift](importing-objective-c-into-swift.md) — Access classes and other declarations from your Objective-C code in Swift.
- [Importing Swift into Objective-C](importing-swift-into-objective-c.md) — Access Swift types and declarations from within your Objective-C codebase.

### Cocoa Frameworks

- [Working with Foundation Types](working-with-foundation-types.md) — Use bridged Foundation types in your Swift codebase to work with dates, times, and other values.
- [Working with Core Foundation Types](working-with-core-foundation-types.md) — Work directly with memory-managed Core Foundation types in your Swift code, and manually handle retains as needed.

### Objective-C APIs

- [Using Imported Lightweight Generics in Swift](using-imported-lightweight-generics-in-swift.md) — Understand the constraints of imported Obj-C lightweight generic type declarations.
- [Using Imported Protocol-Qualified Classes in Swift](using-imported-protocol-qualified-classes-in-swift.md) — Learn how imported Objective-C protocol-qualified classes and metaclasses are represented.

### C APIs

- [Using Imported C Structs and Unions in Swift](using-imported-c-structs-and-unions-in-swift.md) — Learn how Swift represents imported C structures and unions, including types with bitfields and unnamed fields.
- [Using Imported C Functions in Swift](using-imported-c-functions-in-swift.md) — Learn how to call imported functions that are declared in a C header.
- [Using Imported C Macros in Swift](using-imported-c-macros-in-swift.md) — Use imported C-defined macros as constants.
