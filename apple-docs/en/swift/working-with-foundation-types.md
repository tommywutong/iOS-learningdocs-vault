# Working with Foundation Types

<sub>Article</sub>

Use bridged Foundation types in your Swift codebase to work with dates, times, and other values.

## Overview

When importing the Foundation framework, the Swift overlay provides value types for many bridged reference types. Many other types are renamed or nested to clarify relationships.

### Prefer Swift Value Types to Bridged Objective-C Reference Types

The value types in the table below have the same functionality as their corresponding reference types. Class clusters that include immutable and mutable subclasses, like `NSArray` and `NSMutableArray`, are bridged to a single value type.

| Swift value type | Objective-C reference type |
|---|---|
| `AffineTransform` | `NSAffineTransform` |
| `Array` | `NSArray` |
| `Calendar` | `NSCalendar` |
| `CharacterSet` | `NSCharacterSet` |
| `Data` | `NSData` |
| `DateComponents` | `NSDateComponents` |
| `DateInterval` | `NSDateInterval` |
| `Date` | `NSDate` |
| `Decimal` | `NSDecimalNumber` |
| `Dictionary` | `NSDictionary` |
| `IndexPath` | `NSIndexPath` |
| `IndexSet` | `NSIndexSet` |
| `Locale` | `NSLocale` |
| `Measurement` | `NSMeasurement` |
| `Notification` | `NSNotification` |
| Swift numeric types (`Int`, `Float`, and so on) | `NSNumber` |
| `PersonNameComponents` | `NSPersonNameComponents` |
| `Set` | `NSSet` |
| `String` | `NSString` |
| `TimeZone` | `NSTimeZone` |
| `URL` | `NSURL` |
| `URLComponents` | `NSURLComponents` |
| `URLQueryItem` | `NSURLQueryItem` |
| `URLRequest` | `NSURLRequest` |
| `UUID` | `NSUUID` |

When Swift code imports Objective-C APIs, the importer replaces Foundation reference types with their corresponding value types. For this reason, you should almost never need to use a bridged reference type directly in your own code.

If you need the reference semantics that come with the Foundation reference type, you can access it with its original `NS` class name prefix. Cast between a Swift value type and its corresponding reference type by using the `as` keyword.

```swift
let dataValue = Data(base64Encoded: myString)
let dataReference = dataValue as NSData?
```

### Note Renamed Reference Types

For Foundation types that _aren’t_ bridged to value types, the Swift overlay renames classes and protocols, as well as related enumerations and constants. These types and protocols drop their `NS` prefix, with the following exceptions:

- Classes specific to Objective-C or inherently tied to the Objective-C runtime, like `NSObject`, `NSAutoreleasePool`, `NSException`, and `NSProxy`
- Platform-specific classes, like `NSBackgroundActivity`, `NSUserNotification`, and `NSXPCConnection`

Foundation classes often declare enumeration or constant types. When importing these types, Swift moves them to be nested types of their related types. For example, the `NSJSONReadingOptions` option set is imported as `JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions`.
