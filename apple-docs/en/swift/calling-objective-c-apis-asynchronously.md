# Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously

<sub>Article</sub>

Learn how functions and methods that take a completion handler are converted to Swift asynchronous functions.

## Overview

In Cocoa, methods that perform asynchronous operations take a completion handler as their last parameter, and the method calls that block after the operation finishes to return a result or an error. Swift 5.5 and later automatically translates Objective-C methods that take completion handlers into asynchronous methods using Swift’s native concurrency support, in addition to importing the callback-based version of the method into Swift. Because both Swift methods have the same behavior, they share the same page in the documentation.

For information about asynchronous functions, see [Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html) in [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).

### Understand How Swift Imports Completion Handlers

Swift imports Objective-C methods that take a completion handler as two related Swift methods: a method that takes a closure, and an asynchronous method that doesn’t take a closure. For example, consider the [present(completion:)](<../passkit/pkpaymentauthorizationcontroller/present(completion_).md>) method from PassKit. In Objective-C, it’s declared like this:

```occ
- (void)presentWithCompletion:(void (^)(BOOL success))completion;
```

However, in Swift, it’s imported as two methods:

```swift
func present(completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)

func present() async -> Bool
```

The first version, `present(completion:)`, has a return type of `Void` and takes a completion handler. The second version, `present()`, returns a Boolean value and is an asynchronous method.

Methods whose completion handlers populate a [NSError](../foundation/nserror.md) pointer parameter also become throwing methods in Swift, as described in [About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters](about-imported-cocoa-error-parameters.md). The `NSError` parameter on an asynchronous throwing method must also be nullable, which indicates that the parameter is used only to communicate an error. For example, consider the [write(_:timeout:completionHandler:)](<../foundation/urlsessionstreamtask/write(__timeout_completionhandler_).md>) method from [URLSessionStreamTask](../foundation/urlsessionstreamtask.md). In Objective-C, it’s declared like this:

```occ
- (void)writeData:(NSData *)data
          timeout:(NSTimeInterval)timeout
completionHandler:(void (^) (NSError * _Nullable error))completionHandler;
```

As in the previous example, Swift imports this Objective-C method as two methods: an asynchronous method that takes a closure, and an asynchronous throwing method.

```swift
func write(
    _ data: Data, 
    timeout: TimeInterval, 
    completionHandler: @escaping (Error?) -> Void
)

func write(_ data: Data, timeout: TimeInterval) async throws
```

Methods whose completion handlers take multiple arguments become methods that return a tuple. For example, the [sign(_:using:completion:)](<../passkit/pkpasslibrary/sign(__using_completion_).md>) method from PassKit is declared like this in Objective-C:

```occ
- (void)signData:(NSData *)signData 
withSecureElementPass:(PKSecureElementPass *)secureElementPass 
      completion:(void (^)(NSData *signedData, NSData *signature, NSError *error))completion;
```

In Swift it‘s imported as two methods, an asychronous method that takes a closure and an asynchronous throwing method that returns a tuple:

```swift
func sign(
    _ signData: Data, 
    using secureElementPass: PKSecureElementPass, 
    completion: @escaping (Data?, Data?, Error?) -> Void
)

func sign(_ signData: Data, 
    using secureElementPass: PKSecureElementPass
) async throws -> (Data, Data)
```

### Understand the Conversion Rules

The method that takes a completion handler must meet the following requirements:

- The method has a `void` return type.
- The block has a `void` return type.
- The block is called exactly once, on all possible paths of control flow.

If the method has only one parameter and its selector ends with one of the following suffixes, Swift imports the method as an asynchronous method:

- `WithCompletion`
- `WithCompletionHandler`
- `WithCompletionBlock`
- `WithReplyTo`
- `WithReply`

If the method has more than one parameter, and the last parameter’s selector piece is one of the following, Swift imports the method as an asynchronous method:

- `completion`
- `withCompletion`
- `completionHandler`
- `withCompletionHandler`
- `completionBlock`
- `withCompletionBlock`
- `replyTo`
- `withReplyTo`
- `reply`
- `replyTo`

The name of the Swift method is modified from the Objective-C method as follows:

- The selector piece for the completion handler is removed.
- If the selector starts with `get`, that prefix is removed and leading initialisms are converted to lowercase.
- If the selector ends with `Asynchronously`, that suffix is removed.
- If the method calls its completion handler with a nullable parameter, the asynchronous version in Swift is marked with the `@discardableResult` attribute.
