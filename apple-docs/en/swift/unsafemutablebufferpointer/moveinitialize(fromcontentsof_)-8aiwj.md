# moveInitialize(fromContentsOf:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Moves every element of an initialized source buffer into the uninitialized memory referenced by this buffer, leaving the source memory uninitialized and this buffer’s memory initialized.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func moveInitialize(fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>.Index
```

## Parameters

- `source` — A buffer containing the values to copy. The memory region underlying `source` must be initialized.

## Return Value

The index one past the last element of the buffer initialized by this function.

## Discussion

Prior to calling the `moveInitialize(fromContentsOf:)` method on a buffer, the memory it references must be uninitialized, or its `Element` type must be a trivial type. After the call, the memory referenced by the buffer up to, but not including, the returned index is initialized. The memory referenced by `source` is uninitialized after the function returns. The buffer must reference enough memory to accommodate `source.count` elements.

The returned index is the position of the next uninitialized element in the buffer, one past the index of the last element written. If `source` contains no elements, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `startIndex`. If `source` contains as many elements as the buffer can hold, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `endIndex`.

> [!info] Precondition
> `self.count` \>= `source.count`

> [!note] Note
> The memory regions referenced by `source` and this buffer may overlap.
