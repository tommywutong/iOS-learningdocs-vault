# subtract(_:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Removes the elements of the given set from this set.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
mutating func subtract(_ other: Set<Element>)
```

## Parameters

- `other` — Another set.

## Discussion

In the following example, the elements of the `employees` set that are also members of the `neighbors` set are removed. In particular, the names `"Bethany"` and `"Eric"` are removed from `employees`.

```swift
var employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
employees.subtract(neighbors)
print(employees)
// Prints "["Diana", "Chris", "Alicia"]"
```
