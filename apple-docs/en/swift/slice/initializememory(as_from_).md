# initializeMemory(as:from:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Initializes the buffer’s memory with the given elements, binding the initialized memory to the elements’ type.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func initializeMemory<S>(as type: S.Element.Type, from source: S) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, initialized: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<S.Element>) where S : Sequence
```

## Parameters

- `type` — The type of element to which this buffer’s memory will be bound.

- `source` — A sequence of elements with which to initialize the buffer.

## Return Value

An iterator to any elements of `source` that didn’t fit in the buffer, and a typed buffer of the written elements. The returned buffer references memory starting at the same base address as this buffer.

## Discussion

When calling the `initializeMemory(as:from:)` method on a buffer slice, the memory referenced by the slice must be uninitialized or initialized to a trivial type, and must be properly aligned for accessing `S.Element`. The buffer must contain sufficient memory to accommodate `source.underestimatedCount`.

This method initializes the buffer slice with elements from `source` until `source` is exhausted or, if `source` is a sequence but not a collection, the buffer slice has no more room for source’s elements. After calling `initializeMemory(as:from:)`, the memory referenced by the returned `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` instance is bound and initialized to type `S.Element`.
