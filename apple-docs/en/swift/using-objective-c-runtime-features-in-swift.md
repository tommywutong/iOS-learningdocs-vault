# Using Objective-C Runtime Features in Swift

<sub>Article</sub>

Use selectors and key paths to interact with dynamic Objective-C APIs.

## Overview

Some Objective-C APIs—like target-action—accept method or property names as parameters, then use those names to dynamically call or access the methods or properties. In Swift, you use the `#selector` and `#keyPath` expressions to represent those method or property names as selectors or key paths, respectively.

### Use Selectors to Arrange Calls to Objective-C Methods

In Objective-C, a selector is a type that refers to the name of an Objective-C method. In Swift, Objective-C selectors are represented by the [Selector](../objectivec/selector.md) structure, and you create them using the `#selector` expression.

In Swift, you create a selector for an Objective-C method by placing the name of the method within the `#selector` expression: `#selector(MyViewController.tappedButton(_:))`. To construct a selector for a property’s Objective-C getter or setter method, prefix the property name using the `getter:` or `setter:` label, like `#selector(getter: MyViewController.myButton)`. The example below shows a selector being used as part of the target-action pattern to call a method in response to the [touchUpInside](../uikit/uicontrol/event/touchupinside.md) event.

```swift
import UIKit
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    let myButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 50))

    override init(nibName nibNameOrNil: NSNib.Name?, bundle nibBundleOrNil: Bundle?) {
        super.init(nibName: nibNameOrNil, bundle: nibBundleOrNil)
        let action = #selector(MyViewController.tappedButton)
        myButton.addTarget(self, action: action, forControlEvents: .touchUpInside)
    }

    @objc func tappedButton(_ sender: UIButton?) {
        print("tapped button")
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        super.init(coder: coder)
    }
}
```

If you need to disambiguate between overloaded functions, use parenthesized expressions along with the `as` operator to make the `#selector` expression refer unambiguously to a specific overload.

### Use Key Paths to Dynamically Access Objective-C Properties

In Objective-C, a key is a string that identifies a specific property of an object. A key path is a string of dot-separated keys that specifies a sequence of object properties to traverse. Keys and key paths are frequently used for key-value coding (KVC), a mechanism for indirectly accessing an object’s attributes and relationships using string identifiers.

> [!important] Important
> Objective-C key paths are distinct from, but related to, key-path expressions in Swift. For information about key-path expressions, see [Key-Path Expression](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/expressions#Key-Path-Expression) in [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).

You use the `#keyPath` string expression to create compiler-checked keys and key paths that can be used by KVC methods like [value(forKey:)](<../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/value(forkey_).md>) and [value(forKeyPath:)](<../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/value(forkeypath_).md>). The `#keyPath` string expression accepts chained method or property references. It also supports chaining through optional values within a chain, such as `#keyPath(Person.bestFriend.name)`. Key paths created using the `#keyPath` string expression don’t pass type information about the properties or methods they reference to the APIs that accept key paths.

The example below defines a `Person` class, creates two instances of it, and uses several `#keyPath` string expressions to access properties and properties of those properties:

```swift
class Person: NSObject {
    @objc var name: String
    @objc var friends: [Person] = []
    @objc var bestFriend: Person? = nil

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

let gabrielle = Person(name: "Gabrielle")
let jim = Person(name: "Jim")
let yuanyuan = Person(name: "Yuanyuan")
gabrielle.friends = [jim, yuanyuan]
gabrielle.bestFriend = yuanyuan

#keyPath(Person.name)
// "name"
gabrielle.value(forKey: #keyPath(Person.name))
// "Gabrielle"
#keyPath(Person.bestFriend.name)
// "bestFriend.name"
gabrielle.value(forKeyPath: #keyPath(Person.bestFriend.name))
// "Yuanyuan"
#keyPath(Person.friends.name)
// "friends.name"
gabrielle.value(forKeyPath: #keyPath(Person.friends.name))
// ["Yuanyuan", "Jim"]
```
