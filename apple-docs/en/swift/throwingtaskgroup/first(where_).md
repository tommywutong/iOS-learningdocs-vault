# first(where:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func first(where predicate: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?
```

## Parameters

- `predicate` — A closure that takes an element of the asynchronous sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the element is a match.

## Return Value

The first element of the sequence that satisfies `predicate`, or `nil` if there is no element that satisfies `predicate`.

## Discussion

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The `first(where:)` method returns the first member of the sequence that’s evenly divisible by both `2` and `3`.

```swift
let divisibleBy2And3 = await Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .first { $0 % 2 == 0 && $0 % 3 == 0 }
print(divisibleBy2And3 ?? "none")
// Prints "6"
```

The predicate executes each time the asynchronous sequence produces an element, until either the predicate finds a match or the sequence ends.

- [makeAsyncIterator()](<makeasynciterator().md>) — Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.
- [allSatisfy(_:)](<allsatisfy(__).md>) — Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.
- [compactMap(_:)](<compactmap(__)-944nh.md>) — Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

- [contains(_:)](<contains(__).md>) — Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains the given element.
- [contains(where:)](<contains(where_).md>) — Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
- [drop(while:)](<drop(while_).md>) — Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
