# Objective-C and C Code Customization

Apply macros to your Objective-C APIs to customize how they’re imported into Swift.

## Topics

### Customizing Objective-C APIs

- [Designating Nullability in Objective-C APIs](designating-nullability-in-objective-c-apis.md) — Use nullability annotations or mark regions as annotated to control how Objective-C declarations are imported into Swift.
- [Renaming Objective-C APIs for Swift](renaming-objective-c-apis-for-swift.md) — Use the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro to customize API names for Swift.
- [Improving Objective-C API Declarations for Swift](improving-objective-c-api-declarations-for-swift.md) — Use the `NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT` macro to change how an API is imported into Swift.
- [Grouping Related Objective-C Constants](grouping-related-objective-c-constants.md) — Add macros to your Objective-C types to group their values in Swift.
- [Marking API Availability in Objective-C](marking-api-availability-in-objective-c.md) — Use a macro to denote the availability of an Objective-C API.
- [Making Objective-C APIs Unavailable in Swift](making-objective-c-apis-unavailable-in-swift.md) — Use the `NS_SWIFT_UNAVAILABLE` macro to prevent an API from being used in Swift.

### Customizing C APIs

- [Customizing Your C Code for Swift](customizing-your-c-code-for-swift.md) — Use the `CF_SWIFT_NAME` macro to group functions that have related behavior.
