# Swift Standard Library

Solve complex problems and write high-performance, readable code.

## Overview

The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs, including:

- Fundamental data types such as [Int](int.md), [Double](double.md), and [String](string.md)
- Common data structures such as [Array](array.md), [Dictionary](dictionary.md), and [Set](set.md)
- Global functions such as [print(_:separator:terminator:)](<print(__separator_terminator_).md>) and [abs(_:)](<abs(__).md>)
- Protocols, such as [Collection](collection.md) and [Equatable](equatable.md), that describe common abstractions.
- Protocols, such as [CustomDebugStringConvertible](customdebugstringconvertible.md) and [CustomReflectable](customreflectable.md), that you use to customize operations that are available to all types.
- Protocols, such as [OptionSet](optionset.md), that you use to provide implementations that would otherwise require boilerplate code.

## Topics

### Values and Collections

- [Numbers and Basic Values](numbers-and-basic-values.md) — Model data with numbers, Boolean values, and other fundamental types.
- [Strings and Text](strings-and-text.md) — Work with text using Unicode-safe strings.
- [Collections](collections.md) — Store and organize data using arrays, dictionaries, sets, and other data structures.
- [Time](time-and-duration.md) — Measure how long an operation takes and determine schedules in the future.

### Tools for Your Types

- [Basic Behaviors](basic-behaviors.md) — Use your custom types in operations that depend on testing for equality or order and as members of sets and dictionaries.
- [Encoding, Decoding, and Serialization](encoding-decoding-and-serialization.md) — Serialize and deserialize instances of your types with implicit or customized encoding.
- [Initialization with Literals](initialization-with-literals.md) — Allow values of your type to be expressed using different kinds of literals.

### Programming Tasks

- [Input and Output](input-and-output.md) — Print values to the console, read from and write to text streams, and use command line arguments.
- [Debugging and Reflection](debugging-and-reflection.md) — Fortify your code with runtime checks, and examine your values’ runtime representation.
- [Macros](macros.md) — Generate boilerplate code and perform other compile-time operations.
- [Concurrency](concurrency.md) — Perform asynchronous and parallel operations.
- [Key-Path Expressions](key-path-expressions.md) — Use key-path expressions to access properties dynamically.
- [Manual Memory Management](manual-memory-management.md) — Allocate and manage memory manually.
- [Type Casting and Existential Types](type-casting-and-existential-types.md) — Perform casts between types or represent values of any type.
- [C Interoperability](c-interoperability.md) — Use imported C types or call C variadic functions.
- [Operator Declarations](operator-declarations.md) — Work with prefix, postfix, and infix operators.

### Deprecated

- [Deprecated](deprecated.md)

- [Int](int.md) — A signed integer value type.
- [Double](double.md) — A double-precision (64-bit), floating-point value type.
- [String](string.md) — A Unicode string value that is a collection of characters.
- [Array](array.md) — An ordered, random-access collection.
- [Dictionary](dictionary.md) — A collection whose elements are key-value pairs.
