# init(_:bufferingPolicy:_:)

<sub>Initializer</sub>

Constructs an asynchronous stream for an element type, using the specified buffering policy and element-producing closure.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
init(_ elementType: Element.Type = Element.self, bufferingPolicy limit: AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.BufferingPolicy = .unbounded, _ build: (AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation) -> Void)
```

## Parameters

- `elementType` — The type of element the `AsyncStream` produces.

- `limit` — A `Continuation.BufferingPolicy` value to set the stream’s buffering behavior. By default, the stream buffers an unlimited number of elements. You can also set the policy to buffer a specified number of oldest or newest elements.

- `build` — A custom closure that yields values to the `AsyncStream`. This closure receives an `AsyncStream.Continuation` instance that it uses to provide elements to the stream and terminate the stream when finished.

## Discussion

The `AsyncStream.Continuation` received by the `build` closure is appropriate for use in concurrent contexts. It is thread safe to send and finish; all calls to the continuation are serialized. However, calling this from multiple concurrent contexts could result in out-of-order delivery.

The following example shows an `AsyncStream` created with this initializer that produces 100 random numbers on a one-second interval, calling `yield(_:)` to deliver each element to the awaiting call point. When the `for` loop exits, the stream finishes by calling the continuation’s `finish()` method.

```swift
let stream = AsyncStream<Int>(Int.self,
                              bufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(5)) { continuation in
    Task.detached {
        for _ in 0..<100 {
            await Task.sleep(1 * 1_000_000_000)
            continuation.yield(Int.random(in: 1...10))
        }
        continuation.finish()
    }
}

// Call point:
for await random in stream {
    print(random)
}
```
