# Declared Age Range

<sub>Framework</sub>

Create age-appropriate experiences in your app by asking people to share their age range.

## Overview

Use the Declared Age Range API to request that people share their age range with your app. For children in a Family Sharing group, a parent or guardian or the Family Organizer can decide whether to always share a child’s age information with your app, ask the child every time, or never share their age information. Along with an age range, the system returns an [AgeRangeDeclaration](declaredagerange/agerangeservice/agerangedeclaration.md) for the age range a person provides. To use the Declared Age Range API, add the [com.apple.developer.declared-age-range](bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.declared-age-range.md) entitlement to your app by enabling the Declared Age Range capability on your target in Xcode. For more information, see [Adding capabilities to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app).

> [!important] Important
> Data from the Declared Age Range API is based on information declared by an end user, or their parent or guardian, and may be confirmed using a payment method (like a credit card), government ID, or another method. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with associated laws or regulations that may apply to your app.
