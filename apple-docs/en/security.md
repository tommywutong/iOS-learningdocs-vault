# Security

<sub>Framework</sub>

Secure the data your app manages, and control access to your app.

## Overview

Use the Security framework to protect information, establish trust, and control access to software. Broadly, security services support these goals:

- Establish a user’s identity (authentication) and then selectively grant access to resources (authorization).
- Secure data, both on disk and in motion across a network connection.
- Ensure the validity of code to be executed for a particular purpose.

As shown in the image below, you can also use lower level cryptographic resources to create new secure services. Cryptography is difficult and the cost of bugs typically so high that it’s rarely a good idea to implement your own cryptography solution. Rely on the Security framework when you need cryptography in your app.

> [!note] Note
> Always use the highest level API that meets your needs. The Security framework is not always your best option. For example, to conduct secure network communications, start by considering the [Foundation](foundation.md) framework’s [URL Loading System](foundation/url-loading-system.md), which builds on the Security framework. Only if your app requires lower level access to security protocol functions would you use the secure transport API directly.
