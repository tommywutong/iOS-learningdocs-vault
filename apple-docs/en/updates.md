- Learn to use Instruments when [Analyzing CPU profiles with call tree views](xcode/analyzing-cpu-profiles-with-call-tree-views.md) to improve app performance, while using [OSSignposter](os/ossignposter.md) to annotate your code.

### Apple Intelligence and Machine Learning

The 27 platform releases include powerful new developer features that supercharge apps with AI capabilities. [App Intents](appintents.md) can connect your app with Siri, Spotlight, and Shortcuts. [Foundation Models](foundationmodels.md) gives you a standard interface to perform powerful AI tasks across Apple-provided and third-party models. [Core AI](coreai.md) lets you connect your own models into the Apple tools as first-class providers. And the [Evaluations](evaluations.md) framework provides a standard interface to evaluate your app’s intelligence-powered features.

#### Siri, Intents, and Spotlight

Your app can integrate with Apple Intelligence in the 27 releases across Apple platforms by leveraging [App Intents](appintents.md), which make the core features of your app available to Siri, Spotlight, and Shortcuts. Widgets and Live Activities also interact with your core app through its intents.

- Read the new [Getting started with the App Intents framework](appintents/getting-started-with-the-app-intents-framework.md) guide to acclimate yourself to app intents. And the new [Creating your first app intent](appintents/creating-your-first-app-intent.md) article gets you familiar with using intents in your own code.
- Learn how to connect your app into [Apple Intelligence and Siri AI](appintents/apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai.md), and explore the code in a sample messaging app in [Integrating your messaging app with Apple Intelligence](appintents/integrating-your-messaging-app-with-apple-intelligence.md).
- Read [Testing your App Intents code](appintentstesting/testing-your-app-intents-code.md) to discover how the new [App Intents Testing](appintentstesting.md) framework makes it easier than ever to test your intents to ensure they behave correctly across different user experiences.
- Messaging apps can use the new [Suggested Actions](suggestedactions.md) framework to privately and securely present actions next to messages. The system can intelligently discover useful information in message text and offer to add an event to the calendar, or add a task to Reminders, or open a location in Maps.
- Use the new [Media Intents](mediaintents.md) framework to enable your media player app to handle Siri requests. Siri turns whatever phrase someone says into an  [AudioSearch](mediaintents/audiosearch.md) type that is sent to your app for handling. The [Responding to audio search and playback requests](mediaintents/responding-to-audio-search-and-playback-requests.md) article shows how to add this capability into your own apps.
- Use [App entities](appintents/app-entities.md) types to give additional information about your app to Siri and Apple Intelligence. Read  [Making app entities available in Spotlight](appintents/making-app-entities-available-in-spotlight.md) to see how to make that information available to Spotlight, as well.
- Follow the sample code to learn about [Adopting App Intents to support system experiences](appintents/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences.md) and ensure Apple Intelligence can interact with your app across Shortcuts, Spotlight, and Siri.
- Experiment with the Travel Tracking sample project included in the article [Adopting App Intents to support system experiences](appintents/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences.md) to see lots of examples of using intents within an app or widget.
- Read [Adding your app’s content to Spotlight indexes](corespotlight/adding-your-app-s-content-to-spotlight-indexes.md) to see how to use [Core Spotlight](corespotlight.md) to give people access to activities and items within your app directly from the Spotlight interface.
- Learn to use the [Visual Intelligence](visualintelligence.md) framework on iOS, iPadOS, and now macOS by reading [Integrating your app with visual intelligence](visualintelligence/integrating-your-app-with-visual-intelligence.md). This enables your app to analyze image data from the camera to identify places and objects.

### Foundation Models

The 27 platform releases add powerful new API to the [Foundation Models](foundationmodels.md) framework. Developers can now use a single, standard interface to connect to all their models – from Apple’s on-device models to the powerful Private Cloud Compute hosted models. Frontier model providers can use the new [LanguageModel](foundationmodels/languagemodel.md) protocol to vend a Swift package to bridge their powerful cloud-hosted models to the Foundation Models API. And with [Core AI](coreai.md), Foundation Models API can access your own models, too.

- Read [Generating content and performing tasks with Foundation Models](foundationmodels/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models.md) to get started building with Foundation Models, and create your first [Prompt](foundationmodels/prompt.md).
- When your app can benefit from a larger, cloud-based model you can learn about [Adding server-side intelligence with Private Cloud Compute](foundationmodels/adding-server-side-intelligence-with-private-cloud-compute.md). With Private Cloud Compute (PCC) you get a larger token context size, and stronger reasoning for handling more complex tasks. The [PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel](foundationmodels/privatecloudcomputelanguagemodel.md) class conforms to [LanguageModel](foundationmodels/languagemodel.md) just as other frontier models do.
- Foundation Models now supports image input as well as text, which you can learn to use by reading [Analyzing images with multimodal prompting](foundationmodels/analyzing-images-with-multimodal-prompting.md). The models can help you classify the image, summarize the content, generate accessibility descriptions on the fly, and more. Use an [Attachment](foundationmodels/attachment.md) to send the image to the model along with your prompt.
- Read [Analyzing the runtime performance of your Foundation Models app](foundationmodels/analyzing-the-runtime-performance-of-your-foundation-models-app.md) to learn about optimization techniques that make the AI components of your app perform their best.
- Learn how to measure and improve your prompts by reading [Evaluating prompts to measure performance and improve model responses](foundationmodels/evaluating-prompts-to-measure-performance-and-improve-model-responses.md) and develop a strategy about [Managing the context window](foundationmodels/managing-the-context-window.md) to optimize token use.

![Screenshot of the Origami sample for Foundation Models on an iPad and iPhone.](../../attachments/1888402a429d36a4343480a43fff149c/origami-hero@2x.png)

Explore the Origami sample that demonstrates Foundation Models with Private Cloud Compute or third-party models, shown in the Platform State of the Union by reading [Origami: Crafting a dynamic tutorial for Apple Intelligence](foundationmodels/origami-crafting-a-dynamic-tutorial-for-apple-intelligence.md).

#### Core AI

The [Core AI](coreai.md) framework includes a set of tools that help you build, run, and deploy your own AI models within your app. Core AI also vends your custom AI models in a format that Foundation Models can use natively, so once adapted to Core AI, your models can interact with the same Foundation Models code you write when working with Apple’s own built-in models.

- Designed for Apple silicon performance, [Integrating on-device AI models in your app with Core AI](coreai/integrating-on-device-ai-models-in-your-app-with-core-ai.md) details how to easily import third-party or your own models into your app, and achieve great performance.
- Read [Managing model specialization and caching](coreai/managing-model-specialization-and-caching.md) to see how best to specialize your AI model, either in advance by [Compiling Core AI models ahead of time](coreai/compiling-core-ai-models-ahead-of-time.md), or cached on first use within the app.

#### Evaluations

- The new [Evaluations](evaluations.md) framework makes it easy to write intuitive Swift code to evaluate the behavior of your model, and validate your app’s behavior due to model results.
- Read [Evaluating language model responses](evaluations/evaluating-language-model-responses.md) to learn how you can build a strategy to evaluate your use of models within your app. Writing evaluations and creating comprehensive coverage is outlined in the article [Designing effective evaluations](evaluations/designing-effective-evaluations.md).
- Good evaluations require time spent [Designing datasets to test your feature](evaluations/designing-evaluation-datasets.md) as well as [Designing specific, measurable criteria in an evaluation suite](evaluations/designing-evaluation-criteria.md). Reading [Generating synthetic datasets](evaluations/generating-synthetic-evaluation-datasets.md) can help you build synthetic data to quickly get even more coverage.

### SwiftUI

- Learn to use reorderable containers in your SwiftUI apps by reading  [Reordering items in lists, stacks, grids, and custom layouts](swiftui/reordering-items-in-lists-stacks-grids-and-custom-layouts.md). See how clean the code can look:

```swift
LazyVStack {
    ForEach(cranes) { crane in
        CraneRow(crane)
    }
    .reorderable()
}
.reorderContainer(
    for: Crane.self
) { difference in
    difference.apply(to: &cranes)
}
```

- Take advantage of the recent improvements in the 27 platform releases when using [ContentBuilder](swiftui/contentbuilder.md) and [ViewBuilder](swiftui/viewbuilder.md).
- The [State()](<swiftui/state().md>) property wrapper has been upgraded in Xcode 27 to be a macro, making it easier to use while getting great performance.
- The new document infrastructure is implemented within [DocumentGroup](swiftui/documentgroup.md) and utilizing more powerful URL types. And explore the new [WritableDocument](swiftui/writabledocument.md) and [ReadableDocument](swiftui/readabledocument.md) protocols.
