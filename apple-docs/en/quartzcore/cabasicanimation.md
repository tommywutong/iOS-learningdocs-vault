# CABasicAnimation

<sub>Class</sub>

An object that provides basic, single-keyframe animation capabilities for a layer property.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
class CABasicAnimation
```

## Overview

You create an instance of  [CABasicAnimation](cabasicanimation.md) using the inherited [+ animationWithKeyPath:](<capropertyanimation/init(keypath_).md>) method, specifying the key path of the property to be animated in the render tree.

For example, you can animate a layer’s scalar (i.e. containing a single value) properties such as its [opacity](calayer/opacity.md). The following code fades in a layer by animating its opacity from `0` to `1`.

```swift
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "opacity") 
animation.fromValue = 0 
animation.toValue = 1
```

Non-scalar properties, such as [backgroundColor](calayer/backgroundcolor.md), can also be animated. Core Animation will interpolate between the [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) color and the [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) color. The animation created in the following code fades a layer’s background color from red to blue.

```swift
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "backgroundColor")
animation.fromValue = NSColor.red.cgColor
animation.toValue = NSColor.blue.cgColor
```

If you want to animate the individual components of a non-scalar property with different values, you pass the values to [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) and [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) as arrays. The following animation moves a layer from `(0, 0)` to `(100, 100)`.

```swift
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
animation.fromValue = [0, 0]
animation.toValue = [100, 100]
```

The `keyPath` can access the individual components of a property. For example, the following animation stretches a layer by animating its [transform](calayer/transform.md) object’s `x` from `1` to `2`.

```swift
let animation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "transform.scale.x")
animation.fromValue = 1
animation.toValue = 2
```

### Setting Interpolation Values

The [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md), [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md) and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) properties define the values being interpolated between. All are optional, and no more than two should be non-`nil`. The object type should match the type of the property being animated.

The interpolation values are used as follows:

- Both [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) are non-`nil`. Interpolates between [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md).
- [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) and [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md) are non-`nil`. Interpolates between [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) and ([fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) + [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md)).
- [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md) and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) are non-`nil`. Interpolates between ([toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) - [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md)) and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md).
- [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) is non-`nil`. Interpolates between [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) and the current presentation value of the property.
- [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) is non-`nil`. Interpolates between the current value of `keyPath` in the target layer’s presentation layer and [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md).
- [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md) is non-`nil`. Interpolates between the current value of `keyPath` in the target layer’s presentation layer and that value plus [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md).
- All properties are `nil`. Interpolates between the previous value of `keyPath` in the target layer’s presentation layer and the current value of  `keyPath` in the target layer’s presentation layer.

## Topics

### Interpolation values

- [fromValue](cabasicanimation/fromvalue.md) — Defines the value the receiver uses to start interpolation.
- [toValue](cabasicanimation/tovalue.md) — Defines the value the receiver uses to end interpolation.
- [byValue](cabasicanimation/byvalue.md) — Defines the value the receiver uses to perform relative interpolation.
