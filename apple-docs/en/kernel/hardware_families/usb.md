# USB

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Implement a driver that supports Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices.

## Overview

Use kernel extensions to implement support for devices with real-time requirements, such as audio and video devices.

> [!note] Note
> For most types of USB drivers, Apple has deprecated the use of kernel extensions. Instead, create a DriverKit extension using [USBDriverKit](../../usbdriverkit.md).

This framework refers to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) _Universal Serial Bus 3.2 Specification_, Revision 1.0, September 22, 2017. You can view this specification and other referenced USB specifications at [http://www.usb.org/](../../http_/www.usb.org.md).

- [IOUSBHostIOSourceClientRecordLink](../iousbhostiosourceclientrecordlink.md) — A structure that represents a USB host input/output source client record entry.
- [IOUSBHostIOSourceClientRecordList](../iousbhostiosourceclientrecordlist.md) — A structure that represents a list of USB host input/output source client records.

### USB Specifications
