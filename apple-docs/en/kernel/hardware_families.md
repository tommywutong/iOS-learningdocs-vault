# Hardware Families

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Add support for specific hardware protocols such as USB, and for standard network, serial, audio, and graphics interfaces. 

## Topics

### Hardware Interconnects

- [ATA](hardware_families/ata.md) — Implement a driver that supports Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) devices.
- [Bluetooth](hardware_families/bluetooth.md) — Implement a driver that supports Bluetooth devices.
- [FireWire](hardware_families/firewire.md) — Implement a driver that supports FireWire devices. 
- [PCI](hardware_families/pci.md) — Implement a driver that supports Thunderbolt devices or PCI cards.
- [USB](hardware_families/usb.md) — Implement a driver that supports Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices.

### Interfaces

- [Audio](hardware_families/audio.md) — Implement a driver that interacts with audio hardware. 
- [Graphics and Displays](hardware_families/graphics_and_displays.md) — Implement a driver that interacts with graphics and video hardware. 
- [HID](hardware_families/hid.md) — Implement a driver that interacts with human interface devices, such as mice and keyboards.
