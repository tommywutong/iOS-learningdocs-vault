# dispatch_async_and_wait_f

<sub>Function</sub>

Submits a function-based work item for execution and returns only after it finishes executing.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
extern void dispatch_async_and_wait_f(dispatch_queue_t queue, void *context, dispatch_function_t work);
```

## Parameters

- `queue` — The queue on which to submit the function. This parameter can’t be `NULL`.

- `context` — The app-defined context parameter to pass to the function.

- `work` — The app-defined function to invoke on the target queue. The first parameter passed to this function is the value in the `context` parameter. This parameter can’t be `NULL`.

## Discussion

This function submits work to the specified queue for execution. Unlike [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md), this function doesn’t return until after the block finishes. Calling this function and targeting the current queue results in deadlock.

Unlike [dispatch_sync](<dispatchqueue/sync(execute_)-3segw.md>), this function respects all attributes of the queue when it executes the `work` function. For example, it respects the quality-of-service level and autorelease frequency of the target queue.

If the runtime has already brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the system uses that same thread to execute the `work` function synchronously. If the runtime hasn’t brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the system executes `work` on the current thread as an optimization. However, these optimizations apply only when `queue` targets a global concurrent queue. If it targets any other queue, the system executes the `work` function on that queue’s thread. For example, if `queue` targets the main queue, the function always runs on the main thread.

Unlike with [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md), no retain is performed on the target queue. Because calls to this function are synchronous, it “borrows” the reference of the caller.
