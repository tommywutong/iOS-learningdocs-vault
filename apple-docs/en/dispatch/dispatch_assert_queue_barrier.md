# dispatch_assert_queue_barrier

<sub>Function</sub>

Generates an assertion if the current block is not running as a barrier on the specified dispatch queue.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
extern void dispatch_assert_queue_barrier(dispatch_queue_t queue);
```

## Parameters

- `queue` — The dispatch queue where you expect the current block to be running. This parameter must not be NULL.

## Discussion

Use this method inside a block to verify that the block is running on the expected dispatch queue and is acting as a barrier on that queue. If you submitted the current block synchronously, the function recurisvely checks the context of the submitting block to ensure that it is also running on the expected dispatch queue. If the block is not running on the expected queue, this method asserts, logs an explanation to the system log, and terminates the app.

This function evaluates where the block is actually executing. For example, if you submit the block to a dispatch queue that targets a different queue, the block is considered to be running on the target queue. A block running on a serial queue is always a barrier.

Calling this function outside of a block running on a dispatch queue is a programmer error. If you do so, the function asserts and terminates your app.
