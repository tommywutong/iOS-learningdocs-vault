# dispatch_queue_create

<sub>Function</sub>

Creates a new dispatch queue to which you can submit blocks.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
extern dispatch_queue_tdispatch_queue_create(const char *label, dispatch_queue_attr_t attr);
```

## Parameters

- `label` — A string label to attach to the queue to uniquely identify it in debugging tools such as Instruments, `sample`, stackshots, and crash reports.  Because applications, libraries, and frameworks can all create their own dispatch queues, a reverse-DNS naming style (_com.example.myqueue_) is recommended.  This parameter is optional and can be `NULL`.

- `attr` — In macOS 10.7 and later or iOS 4.3 and later, specify [DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL](dispatch_queue_serial.md) (or `NULL`) to create a serial queue or specify [DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT](dispatch_queue_concurrent.md) to create a concurrent queue. In earlier versions, you must specify `NULL` for this parameter.

## Return Value

The newly created dispatch queue.

## Discussion

Blocks submitted to a serial queue are executed one at a time in FIFO order. Note, however, that blocks submitted to independent queues may be executed concurrently with respect to each other. Blocks submitted to a concurrent queue are dequeued in FIFO order but may run concurrently if resources are available to do so.

If your app isn’t using ARC, you should call [dispatch_release](dispatch_release.md) on a dispatch queue when it’s no longer needed. Any pending blocks submitted to a queue hold a reference to that queue, so the queue is not deallocated until all pending blocks have completed.
