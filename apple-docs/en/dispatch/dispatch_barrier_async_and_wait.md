# dispatch_barrier_async_and_wait

<sub>Function</sub>

Submits a work item for synchronous execution and marks the work as a barrier for subsequent concurrent tasks.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
extern void dispatch_barrier_async_and_wait(dispatch_queue_t queue, dispatch_block_t block);
```

## Parameters

- `queue` — The queue on which to submit the block. This parameter can’t be `NULL`.

- `block` — The block that contains the work to perform. This block has no return value and no parameters. This parameter can’t be `NULL`.

## Discussion

This function submits work to the specified queue for execution. Unlike [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md), this function doesn’t return until after the block finishes. Calling this function and targeting the current queue results in deadlock.

When submitted to a concurrent queue, `block` doesn’t run until all previously submitted tasks finish executing, and subsequently submitted tasks don’t execute until after `block` finishes. You use barriers to ensure the correct execution order of relevant work. For example, you might use them in reader/writer schemes where the order of read and write tasks is significant. If you submit the work to a non-concurrent queue, this method behaves identically to [dispatch_async_and_wait](<dispatchqueue/asyncandwait(execute_)-1udeu.md>).

Unlike [dispatch_sync](<dispatchqueue/sync(execute_)-3segw.md>), this function respects all attributes of the queue when it executes the block. For example, it respects the quality-of-service level and autorelease frequency of the target queue.

If the runtime has already brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the system uses that same thread to execute any synchronous blocks you submitted using this function. If the runtime hasn’t brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the system executes these synchronous blocks on the current thread as an optimization. However, these optimizations apply only when `queue` targets a global concurrent queue. If it targets any other queue, the system executes the work on that queue’s thread. For example, if `queue` targets the main queue, the block always runs on the main thread.

Unlike with [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md), this method doesn’t retain the `queue` object. Because calls to this function are synchronous, it “borrows” the reference of the caller. Moreover, no `Block_copy` is performed on the block.
