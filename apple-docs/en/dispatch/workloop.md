# Workloop

<sub>API Collection</sub>

A dispatch object that prioritizes the execution of tasks based on their quality-of-service (QoS) level.

## Overview

A workloop is a priority-ordered dispatch queue that uses QoS levels to determine the execution order of tasks. Before it starts executing each new task, the queue evaluates the QoS levels of currently enqueued tasks and selects the one with the highest priority. Tasks with the QoS level `QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE` have the highest priority, followed by tasks with the `QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED` priority, and so on.

A workloop is a type of [dispatch_queue_t](dispatch_queue_t.md) object, and you use the same functions to enqueue new tasks. For example, use the [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md) function to enqueue a task asynchronously.

## Topics

### Creating a Dispatch Workloop

- [dispatch_workloop_t](dispatch_workloop_t.md) — A dispatch queue that prioritizes the execution of tasks based on their quality-of-service level.

### Executing Tasks Synchronously

- [dispatch_sync](<dispatchqueue/sync(execute_)-3segw.md>) — Submits a block object for execution and returns after that block finishes executing.
- [dispatch_async_and_wait](<dispatchqueue/asyncandwait(execute_)-1udeu.md>) — Submits a work item for execution and returns only after it finishes executing.

### Managing Queue Attributes

- [dispatch_set_target_queue](<dispatchobject/settarget(queue_).md>) — Specifies the dispatch queue on which to perform work associated with the current object.
