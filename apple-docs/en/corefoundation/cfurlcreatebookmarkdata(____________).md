# CFURLCreateBookmarkData(_:_:_:_:_:_:)

<sub>Function</sub>

Returns bookmark data for a URL, created with specified options and resource values.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func CFURLCreateBookmarkData(_ allocator: CFAllocator!, _ url: CFURL!, _ options: CFURLBookmarkCreationOptions, _ resourcePropertiesToInclude: CFArray!, _ relativeToURL: CFURL!, _ error: UnsafeMutablePointer<Unmanaged<CFError>?>!) -> Unmanaged<CFData>!
```

## Parameters

- `allocator` — The allocator to use to allocate memory for the new `CFURL` object. Pass `NULL` or [kCFAllocatorDefault](kcfallocatordefault.md) to use the current default allocator.

- `url` — The URL that bookmark data is being created for.

- `options` — Options taken into account when creating the bookmark data. To create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, include (by way of bitwise `OR` operators with any other options in this parameter) the [kCFURLBookmarkCreationWithSecurityScope](cfurlbookmarkcreationoptions/withsecurityscope.md) option. When you later resolve the bookmark, you can use the resulting security-scoped URL to obtain read/write access to the file-system resource pointed to by the URL. If you instead want to create a security-scoped bookmark that, when resolved, enables you to obtain read-only access to a file-system resource, bitwise `OR` this parameter’s value with both the [kCFURLBookmarkCreationWithSecurityScope](cfurlbookmarkcreationoptions/withsecurityscope.md) option and the [kCFURLBookmarkCreationSecurityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess](cfurlbookmarkcreationoptions/securityscopeallowonlyreadaccess.md) option.

- `resourcePropertiesToInclude` — An array of names of URL resource properties. The values of these properties must be of a type that the bookmark generation code can serialize. Specifically, the values can contain any of the following primitive types: - `NSString` or `CFString` - `NSData` or `CFData` - `NSDate` or `CFDate` - `NSNumber` or `CFNumber` - `CFBoolean` - `NSURL` or `CFURL` - `CFNull` - `CFUUID` In addition, the properties can contain the following collection classes: - `NSArray` or `CFArray` containing only the above primitive types - `NSDictionary` or `CFDictionary` with `NSString` or `CFString` keys, in which all values contain only the above primitive types

- `relativeToURL` — The URL that the bookmark data is relative to. If you are creating a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, use this parameter as follows: - To create an app-scoped bookmark, use a value of `nil`. - To create a document-scoped bookmark, use the _absolute_ path (despite this parameter’s name) to the document file that is to own the new security-scoped bookmark.

- `error` — The error that occurred in the case that the bookmark data cannot be created.

## Return Value

The bookmark data for the URL.

## Discussion

To use this function to create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, you must first have enabled the appropriate entitlements for your app, as described in [Enabling Security-Scoped Bookmark and URL Access](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW18). In addition, be sure to understand the behavior of the `options` and `relativeToURL` parameters.

For an app-scoped bookmark, no sandboxed app other than the one that created the bookmark can obtain access to the file-system resource that the URL (obtained from the bookmark) points to. Specifically, a bookmark created with security scope fails to resolve if the caller does not have the same code signing identity as the caller that created the bookmark.

For a document-scoped bookmark, any sandboxed app that has access to the bookmark data itself, and has access to the document that owns the bookmark, can obtain access to the resource.

> [!note] Version note
> Security-scoped bookmarks are not available in versions of macOS prior to OS X v10.7.3.
