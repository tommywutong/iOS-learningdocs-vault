# SetResult

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

Returns the result of an authorization operation.

<sub>Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```objc
int (*)(struct __OpaqueAuthorizationEngine *, enum AuthorizationResult) SetResult;
```

## Parameters

- `inEngine` — An opaque handle that is passed to your plug-in when the authorization engine calls your [MechanismCreate](../authorizationplugininterface/mechanismcreate.md) function.

- `inResult` — The result of the authorization attempt. See [AuthorizationResult](../authorizationresult.md) for possible values.

## Return Value

A result code. Possible results are [errAuthorizationSuccess](../errauthorizationsuccess.md) (no error) and [errAuthorizationInternal](../errauthorizationinternal.md) (Security Server internal error).

## Discussion

When an application calls the [AuthorizationCopyRights](<../authorizationcopyrights(__________).md>) function to request a specific authorization right, the Security Agent looks for that right in the authorization policy database. If that right corresponds to your plug-in, the authorization engine calls the [MechanismInvoke](../authorizationplugininterface/mechanisminvoke.md) function for each mechanism listed in the policy database for your plug-in.

When the authorization engine calls your [MechanismInvoke](../authorizationplugininterface/mechanisminvoke.md) function, your plug-in should invoke the specified mechanism to attempt an authorization operation. You use the `SetResult` function to return the results of this operation. If the mechanism returns [kAuthorizationResultAllow](../authorizationresult/kauthorizationresultallow.md), then the authorization engine calls the next mechanism (if any) specified in the authorization policy database for the policy. If any of the mechanisms report a result other than [kAuthorizationResultAllow](../authorizationresult/kauthorizationresultallow.md), the authorization attempt fails. If all of the mechanisms report results of [kAuthorizationResultAllow](../authorizationresult/kauthorizationresultallow.md), the authorization is considered to have succeeded.

Note that you can spin off a separate process and return from [MechanismInvoke](../authorizationplugininterface/mechanisminvoke.md) before calling `SetResult`. For example, you might do so to avoid blocking the Security Server if your mechanism takes a significant amount of time to complete or if you want to be able to cancel the operation by calling the [RequestInterrupt](requestinterrupt.md) function (if, for example, the user has clicked Cancel).In that case, your separate process must call the `SetResult` function to report the result; the authorization engine does not call the next mechanism until you do so.

The authorization engine sends you the entry point to the `SetResult` function in an [AuthorizationCallbacks](../authorizationcallbacks.md) structure when you call the [AuthorizationPluginCreate](../authorizationplugincreate.md) function.
