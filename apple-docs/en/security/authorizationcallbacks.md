# AuthorizationCallbacks

<sub>Structure</sub>

The interface implemented by the Security Server.

<sub>Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```objc
typedef struct AuthorizationCallbacks { ... } AuthorizationCallbacks;
```

## Overview

This structure declares the functions that your authorization plug-in uses to communicate with the authorization engine. These functions are passed to your plug-in through the [AuthorizationPluginCreate](authorizationplugincreate.md) function.

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [SetResult](authorizationcallbacks/setresult.md) — Returns the result of an authorization operation.
- [RequestInterrupt](authorizationcallbacks/requestinterrupt.md) — Requests the authorization engine to interrupt the currently active authorization mechanism.
- [DidDeactivate](authorizationcallbacks/diddeactivate.md) — Reports the successful deactivation of an authorization mechanism.
- [GetContextValue](authorizationcallbacks/getcontextvalue.md) — Reads a value collected during authorization.
- [SetContextValue](authorizationcallbacks/setcontextvalue.md) — Stores data collected during authorization as a key-value pair.
- [RemoveContextValue](authorizationcallbacks/removecontextvalue.md) — Removes a value collected during authorization.
- [GetHintValue](authorizationcallbacks/gethintvalue.md) — Reads a value stored by the plug-in authorization mechanism.
- [GetImmutableHintValue](authorizationcallbacks/getimmutablehintvalue.md) — Reads an immutable value stored by the plug-in authorization mechanism.
- [SetHintValue](authorizationcallbacks/sethintvalue.md) — Stores data needed during authorization as a key-value pair.
- [RemoveHintValue](authorizationcallbacks/removehintvalue.md) — Removes a value stored by the plug-in authorization mechanism.
- [GetArguments](authorizationcallbacks/getarguments.md) — Reads the arguments for this authorization mechanism from the authorization policy database.
- [GetSessionId](authorizationcallbacks/getsessionid.md) — Reads the session ID.
- [GetLAContext](authorizationcallbacks/getlacontext.md) — Constructs a local authentication context.
