# App Sandbox

Restrict access to system resources and user data in macOS apps to contain damage if an app becomes compromised.

## Overview

App Sandbox provides protection to system resources and user data by limiting your app’s access to resources requested through entitlements.

> [!important] Important
> To distribute a macOS app through the Mac App Store, you must enable the App Sandbox capability.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [App Sandbox Entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.app-sandbox.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may use access control technology to contain damage to the system and user data if an app is compromised.
- [Protecting user data with App Sandbox](protecting-user-data-with-app-sandbox.md) — Guard user data and operating system resources from malicious attacks by limiting your app’s access to files, network connections, and hardware capabilities.
- [Embedding a command-line tool in a sandboxed app](../xcode/embedding-a-helper-tool-in-a-sandboxed-app.md) — Add a command-line tool to a sandboxed app’s Xcode project so the resulting app can run it as a helper tool.
- [Discovering and diagnosing App Sandbox violations](discovering-and-diagnosing-app-sandbox-violations.md) — Determine when your macOS app behaves incorrectly because of a sandbox violation, and fix sandbox-related issues.

### Network

- [com.apple.security.network.server](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.network.server.md) — A Boolean value indicating whether your app may listen for incoming network connections.
- [com.apple.security.network.client](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.network.client.md) — A Boolean value indicating whether your app may open outgoing network connections.

### Hardware

- [Camera entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.device.camera.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may interact with the built-in and external cameras, and capture movies and still images.
- [com.apple.security.device.microphone](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.device.microphone.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may use the microphone.
- [com.apple.security.device.usb](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.device.usb.md) — A Boolean value indicating whether your app may interact with USB devices.
- [com.apple.security.print](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.print.md) — A Boolean value indicating whether your app may print a document.
- [com.apple.security.device.bluetooth](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.device.bluetooth.md) — A Boolean value indicating whether your app may interact with Bluetooth devices.

### App Data

- [Address book entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.personal-information.addressbook.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to contacts in the user’s address book.
- [Location entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.personal-information.location.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may access location information from Location Services.
- [Calendars entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.personal-information.calendars.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to the user’s calendar.

### File Access

- [Accessing files from the macOS App Sandbox](accessing-files-from-the-macos-app-sandbox.md) — Read and write documents and supporting files while maintaining security protection.
- [Migrating your app’s files to its App Sandbox container](migrating-your-app-s-files-to-its-app-sandbox-container.md) — Simplify your app’s access to documents and supporting files.
- [com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-only access to files the user has selected using an Open or Save dialog.
- [com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to files the user has selected using an Open or Save dialog.
- [com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-only](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-only.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-only access to the Downloads folder.
- [com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to the Downloads folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-only](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-only.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-only access to the Pictures folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-write](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-write.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to the Pictures folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.music.read-only](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.music.read-only.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-only access to the Music folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.music.read-write](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.music.read-write.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to the Music folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.movies.read-only](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.movies.read-only.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-only access to the Movies folder.
- [com.apple.security.assets.movies.read-write](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.assets.movies.read-write.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have read-write access to the Movies folder.
- [All files entitlement](../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.files.all.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may have access to all files. _(deprecated)_
- [NSAppDataUsageDescription](../bundleresources/information-property-list/nsappdatausagedescription.md) — A message that tells people why the app needs to access files in other apps’ sandbox containers.
