# MechanismCreate

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

Creates an authorization mechanism.

<sub>Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```objc
int (*)(void *, struct __OpaqueAuthorizationEngine *, const char *, void **) MechanismCreate;
```

## Parameters

- `inPlugin` — The authorization plug-in reference you assigned to the plug-in in the [AuthorizationPluginCreate](../authorizationplugincreate.md) function.

- `inEngine` — An opaque handle that you must pass back to the authorization engine when you call one of the engine’s callback functions.

- `mechanismId` — The mechanism ID specified in the authorization policy database is passed to the plug-in so that the plug-in can create the appropriate mechanism.

- `outMechanism` — On output, points to an authorization mechanism reference that you define. The authorization engine includes this reference when it calls your plug-in so that you can identify which instance of a mechanism to invoke, deactivate, or destroy.

## Return Value

A result code. Return [errAuthorizationSuccess](../errauthorizationsuccess.md) (no error) if the function completes successfully and [errAuthorizationInternal](../errauthorizationinternal.md) (Security Server internal error) if any error occurs.

## Discussion

A given authorization plug-in can implement any number of authorization mechanisms, distinguished by their mechanism names in the authorization policy database.

When the authorization engine calls your [MechanismCreate](mechanismcreate.md) function, you should create a mechanism of the type specified by the mechanismID parameter and return an authorization mechanism reference. Subsequently, the authorization engine can call your [MechanismInvoke](mechanisminvoke.md) function to perform an authorization, or can direct you to deactivate or destroy the mechanism instance by calling your [MechanismDeactivate](mechanismdeactivate.md) or [MechanismDestroy](mechanismdestroy.md) functions.
