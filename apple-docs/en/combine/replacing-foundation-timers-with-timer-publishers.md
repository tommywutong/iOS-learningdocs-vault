# Replacing Foundation Timers with Timer Publishers

<sub>Article</sub>

Publish elements periodically by using a timer.

## Overview

If your app uses Foundation’s [Timer](../foundation/timer.md) class to repeatedly receive a callback or invoke a closure on a specified interval, you can convert these instances to Combine to simplify your code.

### Performing Periodic Work with a Timer

Consider the following snippet, which uses [scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:repeats:block:)](<../foundation/timer/scheduledtimer(withtimeinterval_repeats_block_).md>) to update the `lastUpdated` property of a data model once a second, on a specific dispatch queue:

```swift
var timer: Timer?
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) { _ in
        self.myDispatchQueue.async() {
            self.myDataModel.lastUpdated = Date()
        }
    }
}
```

### Converting to a Timer Publisher

To migrate this code to Combine, replace the [Timer](../foundation/timer.md) that is returned by [scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:repeats:block:)](<../foundation/timer/scheduledtimer(withtimeinterval_repeats_block_).md>) with a [Timer.TimerPublisher](../foundation/timer/timerpublisher.md). You create this publisher with the [Timer](../foundation/timer.md) method [publish(every:tolerance:on:in:options:)](<../foundation/timer/publish(every_tolerance_on_in_options_).md>). Every time the underyling [Timer](../foundation/timer.md) fires, the publisher emits a new [Date](../foundation/date.md) that represents the instant the timer fired. You then apply Combine operators to the [Date](../foundation/date.md), eventually connecting the publisher to a subscriber like [sink(receiveValue:)](<publisher/sink(receivevalue_).md>) or [assign(to:on:)](<publisher/assign(to_on_).md>).

> [!tip] Tip
> Because [Timer.TimerPublisher](../foundation/timer/timerpublisher.md) conforms to the [ConnectablePublisher](connectablepublisher.md) protocol, it won’t produce elements until you explicitly connect to it. Do this by either calling [connect()](<connectablepublisher/connect().md>), or using an [autoconnect()](<connectablepublisher/autoconnect().md>) operator to connect automatically when a subscriber attaches.

The next example shows how to use a [Timer.TimerPublisher](../foundation/timer/timerpublisher.md) to replace the previous example. It uses Combine’s operators to perform the tasks that were in the previous example’s closure:

```swift
var cancellable: Cancellable?
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    cancellable = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .default)
        .autoconnect()
        .receive(on: myDispatchQueue)
        .assign(to: \.lastUpdated, on: myDataModel)
}
```

In this example, Combine operators replace all the behavior inside the closure of the earlier example:

- The [receive(on:options:)](<publisher/receive(on_options_).md>) operator ensures that its subsequent operators run on the specified dispatch queue. This replaces the `async()` call from before.
- The [assign(to:on:)](<publisher/assign(to_on_).md>) operator updates the data model, by using a key path to set the `lastUpdate` property.

Another advantage you’ll find when using Combine to simplify your code is that the [Timer.TimerPublisher](../foundation/timer/timerpublisher.md) produces new [Date](../foundation/date.md) instances as its output type. The first example’s closure receives the [Timer](../foundation/timer.md) itself as its parameter, so it has to create new [Date](../foundation/date.md) instances manually.
