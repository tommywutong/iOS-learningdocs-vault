# Publishers.SetFailureType

<sub>Structure</sub>

A publisher that appears to send a specified failure type.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
struct SetFailureType<Upstream, Failure> where Upstream : Publisher, Failure : Error, Upstream.Failure == Never
```

## Overview

The publisher can’t actually fail with the specified type and finishes normally. Use this publisher type when you need to match the error types for two mismatched publishers.

## Relationships

- **Conforms To**: [Equatable](../../swift/equatable.md), [Publisher](../publisher.md)

## Topics

### Creating a set failure type publisher

- [init(upstream:)](<setfailuretype/init(upstream_).md>) — Creates a publisher that appears to send a specified failure type.

### Setting failure type

- [setFailureType(to:)](<setfailuretype/setfailuretype(to_).md>) — Changes the failure type declared by the upstream publisher.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Output](setfailuretype/output.md) — The kind of values published by this publisher.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](setfailuretype/upstream.md) — The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

### Comparing publishers

- [==(_:_:)](<setfailuretype/==(____).md>) — Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

### Default Implementations

- [Equatable Implementations](setfailuretype/equatable-implementations.md)

## See Also

### Mapping elements

- [Map](map.md) — A publisher that transforms all elements from the upstream publisher with a provided closure.
- [TryMap](trymap.md) — A publisher that transforms all elements from the upstream publisher with a provided error-throwing closure.
- [MapError](maperror.md) — A publisher that converts any failure from the upstream publisher into a new error.
- [Scan](scan.md) — A publisher that transforms elements from the upstream publisher by providing the current element to a closure along with the last value returned by the closure.
- [TryScan](tryscan.md) — A publisher that transforms elements from the upstream publisher by providing the current element to a failable closure along with the last value returned by the closure.
