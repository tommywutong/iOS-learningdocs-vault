# Deleting persistent data from your app

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Explore different ways to use SwiftData to delete persistent data.

## Overview

Data-driven apps typically provide a way for a person to delete data, and this sample is no exception. It shows three ways to remove data stored in a SwiftData model container:

- Swiping to delete
- Deleting with confirmation
- Deleting all

> [!note] Note

## Swipe to delete

The sample app shows a list of animals. A person using the app can delete an animal using a swipe gesture. For example, the following code adds the swipe-to-delete option to the `AnimalList` view by applying the [onDelete(perform:)](<../swiftui/dynamicviewcontent/ondelete(perform_).md>) modifier to [ForEach](../swiftui/foreach.md):

```swift
private struct AnimalList: View {
    @Environment(NavigationContext.self) private var navigationContext
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Query(sort: \Animal.name) private var animals: [Animal]

    var body: some View {
        @Bindable var navigationContext = navigationContext
        List(selection: $navigationContext.selectedAnimal) {
            ForEach(animals) { animal in
                NavigationLink(animal.name, value: animal)
            }
            .onDelete(perform: removeAnimals)
        }
    }
}
```

The [onDelete(perform:)](<../swiftui/dynamicviewcontent/ondelete(perform_).md>) modifier in the previous code calls the custom method `removeAnimals` to remove one or more animals from the list. This method receives an [IndexSet](../foundation/indexset.md) which identifies the animals to delete. The method then iterates through the index set, deleting each animal using the [ModelContext](modelcontext.md) method [delete(_:)](<modelcontext/delete(__).md>).

```swift
private func removeAnimals(at indexSet: IndexSet) {
    for index in indexSet {
        modelContext.delete(animals[index])
    }
}
```

However, it’s possible for a person using this sample to delete the selected animal, so the `removeAnimals` method needs to unselect the animal before deleting it. The updated version of `removeAnimals` uses the [persistentModelID](persistentmodel/persistentmodelid.md) to determine whether the animal to delete is also the selected animal. If it is, the method sets the selected animal to `nil`.

```swift
private func removeAnimals(at indexSet: IndexSet) {
    for index in indexSet {
        let animalToDelete = animals[index]
        if navigationContext.selectedAnimal?.persistentModelID == animalToDelete.persistentModelID {
            navigationContext.selectedAnimal = nil
        }
        modelContext.delete(animalToDelete)
    }
}
```

The sample uses the SwiftData autosave feature, which is enabled by default when creating a [ModelContainer](modelcontainer.md) using the [modelContainer(for:inMemory:isAutosaveEnabled:isUndoEnabled:onSetup:)](<../swiftui/view/modelcontainer(for_inmemory_isautosaveenabled_isundoenabled_onsetup_)-18hhy.md>) modifier. If this feature is disabled, the `removeAnimals` method needs to explicitly save the change by calling the [ModelContext](modelcontext.md) method [save()](<modelcontext/save().md>); for example:

```swift
private func removeAnimals(at indexSet: IndexSet) {
    do {
	    for index in indexSet {
	        let animalToDelete = animals[index]
	        if navigationContext.selectedAnimal?.persistentModelID == animalToDelete.persistentModelID {
	            navigationContext.selectedAnimal = nil
	        }
	        modelContext.delete(animalToDelete)
	    }
        try modelContext.save()
    } catch {
        // Handle error.
    }
}
```

> [!note] Note
> To disable the autosave feature, set the `isAutoSaveEnabled` parameter to `false` when creating the model container using the [modelContainer(for:inMemory:isAutosaveEnabled:isUndoEnabled:onSetup:)](<../swiftui/view/modelcontainer(for_inmemory_isautosaveenabled_isundoenabled_onsetup_)-18hhy.md>) modifier. You can also disable autosave by setting set the model context property [autosaveEnabled](modelcontext/autosaveenabled.md) to `false`.

## Delete with confirmation

The sample app also lets a person delete the selected animal by clicking the Trash button that `AnimalDetailView` displays in its toolbar.

```swift
struct AnimalDetailView: View {
    var animal: Animal?
    @State private var isDeleting = false
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Environment(NavigationContext.self) private var navigationContext

    var body: some View {
        if let animal {
            AnimalDetailContentView(animal: animal)
                .navigationTitle("\(animal.name)")
                .toolbar {
                    Button { isDeleting = true } label: {
                        Label("Delete \(animal.name)", systemImage: "trash")
                            .help("Delete the animal")
                    }
                }
        } else {
            ContentUnavailableView("Select an animal", systemImage: "pawprint")
        }
    }
}
```

The action for the button set the state variable `isDeleting` to `true`, which displays the delete confirmation alert described in the following code:

```swift
.alert("Delete \(animal.name)?", isPresented: $isDeleting) {
    Button("Yes, delete \(animal.name)", role: .destructive) {
        delete(animal)
    }
}
```

After confirming the delete request, the action for the confirmation button calls the custom `delete` method. This method sets the selected animal to `nil`, then deletes the animal from the model context by calling the [delete(_:)](<modelcontext/delete(__).md>) method.

```swift
private func delete(_ animal: Animal) {
    navigationContext.selectedAnimal = nil
    modelContext.delete(animal)
}
```

If the SwiftData autosave feature was disabled, the `delete` method would need to explicitly save the change by calling the `ModelContext` method [save()](<modelcontext/save().md>); for example:

```swift
private func delete(_ animal: Animal) {
    do {
        navigationContext.selectedAnimal = nil
        modelContext.delete(animal)
        try modelContext.save()
    } catch {
        // Handle error.
    }
}
```

## Delete all

Deleting all items of a particular model type is less common in data driven apps, but there may be times when having this option is helpful. For example, the sample apps lets a person reload sample data that comes with the app. Reloading the sample data deletes all animal categories and animals from persistent storage.

To delete all items of a particular model type, use the [ModelContext](modelcontext.md) method [delete(model:where:includeSubclasses:)](<modelcontext/delete(model_where_includesubclasses_).md>). For example, the following code deletes all animal categories before reloading the sample data:

```swift
static func reloadSampleData(modelContext: ModelContext) {
    do {
        try modelContext.delete(model: AnimalCategory.self)
        insertSampleData(modelContext: modelContext)
    } catch {
        fatalError(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

When deleting all animal categories, SwiftData also deletes all animals within those categories. SwiftData knows to perform this cascading delete because the relationship between `AnimalCategory` and `Animal` uses the [Schema.Relationship.DeleteRule.cascade](schema/relationship/deleterule-swift.enum/cascade.md) delete rule. (For a complete list of delete rules, see [DeleteRule](schema/relationship/deleterule-swift.enum.md).)

```swift
import SwiftData

@Model
final class AnimalCategory {
    @Attribute(.unique) var name: String
    // `.cascade` tells SwiftData to delete all animals contained in the 
    // category when deleting it.
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Animal.category)
    var animals = [Animal]()
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

To delete all persistent data from your app and not just data of a certain model type, use the [ModelContainer](modelcontainer.md) method [deleteAllData()](<modelcontainer/deletealldata().md>).
