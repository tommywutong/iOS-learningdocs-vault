# Relationship(_:deleteRule:minimumModelCount:maximumModelCount:originalName:inverse:hashModifier:)

<sub>Macro</sub>

Specifies the options that SwiftData needs to manage the annotated property as a relationship between two models.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
@attached(peer) macro Relationship(_ options: Schema.Relationship.Option..., deleteRule: Schema.Relationship.DeleteRule = .nullify, minimumModelCount: Int? = 0, maximumModelCount: Int? = 0, originalName: String? = nil, inverse: AnyKeyPath? = nil, hashModifier: String? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `options` — A list of options to apply to the annotated property to customize its behavior. For possible values, see [Option](schema/relationship/option.md).

- `deleteRule` — The rule to apply when you delete the relationship’s owning persistent model. For possible values, see [DeleteRule](schema/relationship/deleterule-swift.enum.md). The default value is [Schema.Relationship.DeleteRule.nullify](schema/relationship/deleterule-swift.enum/nullify.md).

- `minimumModelCount` — The minimum number of models the relationship can reference. The default value is `0`.

- `maximumModelCount` — The maximum number of models the relationship can reference. The default value is `0`.

- `originalName` — The previous name of the attribute, if it’s different to the one in the current schema version. The default value is `nil`.

- `inverse` — The key path of the relationship that represents the inverse of this relationship. The default value is `nil`.

- `hashModifier` — A unique hash value that represents the most recent version of the annotated property. The default value is `nil`.

## Overview

If one or more of a model’s properties represent relationships between their containing model and another model, annotate those properties with the `@Relationship` macro. This enables SwiftData to enforce those relationships at runtime — including what happens if you delete related data – as well as write any associated metadata to the persistent storage so the relationships exist across app launches.

In the following example, a remote image may belong to a category, and a category can contain zero, one, or more images.

```swift
@Model
class RemoteImage {
    @Attribute(.unique) var sourceURL: URL
    @Relationship(inverse: \Category.images) var category: Category?
    var data: Data

    init(sourceURL: URL, data: Data = Data()) {
        self.sourceURL = sourceURL
        self.data = data
    }
}

@Model
class Category {
    @Attribute(.unique) var name: String
    @Relationship var images = [RemoteImage]()

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

> [!note] Note
> If you declare a relationship attribute as optional when defining your persistent models, SwiftData only enforces `minimumModelCount` and `maximumModelCount` when that attribute isn’t nil.

For more information about defining relationships between models, see [Defining data relationships with enumerations and model classes](defining-data-relationships-with-enumerations-and-model-classes.md).

### Model definition

- [Model()](<model().md>) — Converts a Swift class into a stored model that’s managed by SwiftData.
- [Attribute(_:originalName:hashModifier:)](<attribute(__originalname_hashmodifier_).md>) — Specifies the custom behavior that SwiftData applies to the annotated property when managing the owning class.
- [Unique(_:)](<unique(__).md>) — Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to enforce the uniqueness of model instances.
- [Index(_:)](<index(__)-74ia2.md>) — Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more binary indices for the associated model.
- [Index(_:)](<index(__)-7d4z0.md>) — Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more indicies for the associated model, where each index is either binary or R-tree.
- [Defining data relationships with enumerations and model classes](defining-data-relationships-with-enumerations-and-model-classes.md) — Create relationships for static and dynamic data stored in your app.
- [Transient()](<transient().md>) — Tells SwiftData not to persist the annotated property when managing the owning class.
