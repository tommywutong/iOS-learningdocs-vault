## Discussion

A campaign token is a 40-byte string that represents an ad campaign. By setting the `campaignToken`, you can measure the effectiveness of an Apple Services Performance Partners Program link or an App Store Connect Analytics campaign.

For more information, see [Apple Services Performance Partners Program](https://apple.com/itunes/affiliates) and [App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/About.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225).
