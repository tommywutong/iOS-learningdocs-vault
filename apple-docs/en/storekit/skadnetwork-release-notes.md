# SKAdNetwork release notes

Learn about the features in each SKAdNetwork version.

## Overview

Use the most recent version of SKAdNetwork available.

In version 2.0 and later, ad networks use a version number when signing ads. For StoreKit-rendered ads, you set the version number in the [SKStoreProductParameterAdNetworkVersion](skstoreproductparameteradnetworkversion.md) parameter. For view-through ads, you set the version number in the [version](skadimpression/version.md) property.

When you receive an install-validation postback, it contains the version number. Each version of SKAdNetwork has specific instructions for signing ads and validating the postback.

Developers of advertised apps are eligible to receive copies of winning postbacks, versions 2 and later, if the participants meet the following conditions:

- The developer of the advertised app opts-in to receive postbacks. For instructions on opting-in, see [Configuring an advertised app](configuring-an-advertised-app.md).
- The device is running iOS 15 or later.
