# Requesting App Store reviews

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Implement best practices for prompting users to review your app in the App Store.

## Overview

Present your users with a request for an App Store review using [RequestReviewAction](requestreviewaction.md) to get feedback on your app. Be aware that the system displays the review prompt to a user a maximum of three times within a 365-day period. You can determine when and where your app displays the prompt to request a review. Consider the best places and conditions in your app to show the request, and when it might be appropriate to delay it. Here are some best practices:

- Make the request at a time that doesn’t interrupt what someone is trying to achieve in your app, for example, at the end of a sequence of events that they successfully complete.
- Avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app, even if it isn’t the first time it launches.
- Avoid requesting a review as the result of a user action.

Also, remember that people can disable requests for reviews from _ever_ appearing on their device.

### Present the review request

This sample project demonstrates a simulated three-step process. A person taps the Start Process button, and then taps Continue Process twice, after which the app presents a Process Completed scene. The request for review appears from this scene only.

In addition, the app and its use meets the following conditions before displaying the prompt:

- The app hasn’t shown a review prompt for a version of the app bundle that matches the current bundle version. This ensures that a person doesn’t receive a prompt to review the same version of an app multiple times.
- The person successfully completes the three-step process at least four times. This number is arbitrary and developers can choose something that fits well with how many times someone is likely to complete a process in their apps.
- A person must pause on the Process Completed scene for a few seconds. This requirement limits the possibility of the prompt interrupting them before they move to a different task in the app.

To present a review request, the app reads the [`requestReview`](../swiftui/environmentvalues/requestreview.md) environment value to get an instance of `RequestReviewAction` and calls it as a function:

```swift
@Environment(\.requestReview) private var requestReview
```

The conditions above exist purely to delay the call to `requestReview`, so days, weeks, or even months can elapse without the app prompting a user for a review.

```swift
/// Presents the rating and review request view after a two-second delay.
private func presentReview() {
    Task {
        // Delay for two seconds to avoid interrupting the person using the app.
        try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2))
        await requestReview()
    }
}
```

Techniques to delay the call are valuable because they cause an app to show a review request when people are more experienced at using the app and can provide better feedback.

```swift
/*
    The lastVersionPromptedForReview property stores the version of the app that last prompts for a review.
    The app presents the rating and review request view if the person completed the three-step process at least four times and
    its current version is different from the version that last prompted them for review.
*/
if processCompletedCount >= 4, currentAppVersion != lastVersionPromptedForReview {
    presentReview()
        
    // The app already displayed the rating and review request view. Store this current version.
    lastVersionPromptedForReview = currentAppVersion
}
```

In the following code, the app stores the usage data that delays the review request in [`AppStorage`](../swiftui/appstorage.md):

```swift
/// An identifier for the three-step process the person completes before this app chooses to request a review.
@AppStorage("processCompletedCount") var processCompletedCount = 0

/// The most recent app version that prompts for a review.
@AppStorage("lastVersionPromptedForReview") var lastVersionPromptedForReview = ""
```

In other apps, there might be more appropriate on-device storage options. For more information about best practices for requesting reviews, see [Ratings and reviews](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ratings-and-reviews) in Human Interface Guidelines.

### Manually request a review

To enable a person to initiate a review as a result of an action in the UI, the sample code uses a deep link to the App Store page for the app with the query parameter `action=write-review` appended to the URL:

```swift
// Replace the YOURAPPSTOREID value below with the App Store ID for your app.
// You can find the App Store ID in your app's product URL.
let url = "https://apps.apple.com/app/idYOURAPPSTOREID?action=write-review"

guard let writeReviewURL = URL(string: url) else {
    fatalError("Expected a valid URL")
}

openURL(writeReviewURL)
```
