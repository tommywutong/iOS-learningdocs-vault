# Landmarks: Applying a background extension effect

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Configure an image to blur and extend under a sidebar or inspector panel.

## Overview

The Landmarks app lets people explore interesting sites around the world. Whether it’s a national park near their home or a far-flung location on a different continent, the app provides a way for people to organize and mark their adventures and receive custom activity badges along the way.

This sample demonstrates how to apply a background extension effect. In the top Landmarks view, the sample applies a background extension effect to the featured image in `LandmarksView`, and to the main image in `LandmarkDetailView`. The background extension effect blurs and extends the image under the sidebar or inspector panel when open. The following images show the main image in `LandmarkDetailView` both with and without the background extension effect.

**With**

To apply the background extension effect, the sample:

1. Aligns the view to the leading and trailing edges of the containing view.
2. Applies the [backgroundExtensionEffect()](<view/backgroundextensioneffect().md>) modifier to the view.
3. Configures only the image in the background extension, and avoids applying the effect to the title and button in the overlay.

### Align the view to the leading and trailing edges

To apply the [backgroundExtensionEffect()](<view/backgroundextensioneffect().md>) to a view, align the leading edge of the view next to the sidebar, and align the trailing edge of the view to the trailing edge of the containing view.

In `LandmarksView`, the `LandmarkFeaturedItemView` and the containing [LazyVStack](lazyvstack.md) and [ScrollView](scrollview.md) don’t have padding. This allows the `LandmarkFeaturedItemView` to align with the leading edge of the view next to the sidebar.

```swift
ScrollView(showsIndicators: false) {
    LazyVStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: Constants.standardPadding) {
        LandmarkFeaturedItemView(landmark: modelData.featuredLandmark!)
            .flexibleHeaderContent()
        //...
    }
}
```

In `LandmarkDetailView`, the [ScrollView](scrollview.md) and [VStack](vstack.md) that contain the main image also don’t have any padding. This allows the main image to align against the leading edge of the containing view.

### Apply the background extension effect to the image

In `LandmarkDetailView`, the sample applies the background extension effect to the main image by adding the [backgroundExtensionEffect()](<view/backgroundextensioneffect().md>) modifier:

```swift
Image(landmark.backgroundImageName)
    //...
    .backgroundExtensionEffect()
```

When the sidebar is open, the system extends the image in the leading direction as follows:

- The system takes a section of the leading end of the image that matches the width of the sidebar.
- The system flips that portion of the image horizontally toward the leading edge and applies a blur to the flipped section.
- The system places the modified section of the image under the sidebar, immediately before the leading edge of the image.

When the inspector is open, the system extends the image in the trailing direction as follows:

- The system takes a section of the trailing end of the image that matches the width of the sidebar.
- The system flips that portion of the image horizontally toward the trailing edge and applies a blur to the flipped section.
- The system places the modified section of the image under the inspector, immediately after the trailing edge of the image.

### Configure only the image

In `LandmarksView`, the `LandmarkFeaturedItemView` has an image from the featured landmark, and includes a title for the landmark and a button you can click or tap to learn more about that location.

To avoid having the landmark’s title and button appear under the sidebar in macOS, the sample applies the [backgroundExtensionEffect()](<view/backgroundextensioneffect().md>) modifier to the image before adding the overlay that includes the title and button:

```swift
Image(decorative: landmark.backgroundImageName)
    //...
    .backgroundExtensionEffect()
    .overlay(alignment: .bottom) {
        VStack {
            Text("Featured Landmark", comment: "Big headline in the main image of featured landmarks.")
                //...
            Text(landmark.name)
                //...
            Button("Learn More") {
                modelData.path.append(landmark)
            }
            //...
        }
        .padding([.bottom], Constants.learnMoreBottomPadding)
    }

```
