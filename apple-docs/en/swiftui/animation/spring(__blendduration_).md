# spring(_:blendDuration:)

<sub>Type Method</sub>

A persistent spring animation.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
static func spring(_ spring: Spring, blendDuration: TimeInterval = 0.0) -> Animation
```

## Discussion

When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the duration values between springs over a time period.

### Customizing spring animations

- [spring](spring.md) — A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.
- [spring(duration:bounce:blendDuration:)](<spring(duration_bounce_blendduration_).md>) — A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the duration values between springs over a time period.
- [spring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)](<spring(response_dampingfraction_blendduration_).md>) — A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.
- [interactiveSpring](interactivespring.md) — A convenience for a `spring` animation with a lower `duration` value, intended for driving interactive animations.
- [interactiveSpring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)](<interactivespring(response_dampingfraction_blendduration_).md>) — A convenience for a `spring` animation with a lower `response` value, intended for driving interactive animations.
- [interpolatingSpring](interpolatingspring.md) — An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
- [interpolatingSpring(_:initialVelocity:)](<interpolatingspring(__initialvelocity_).md>) — An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range of one to zero.
- [interpolatingSpring(duration:bounce:initialVelocity:)](<interpolatingspring(duration_bounce_initialvelocity_).md>) — An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
- [interpolatingSpring(mass:stiffness:damping:initialVelocity:)](<interpolatingspring(mass_stiffness_damping_initialvelocity_).md>) — An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
