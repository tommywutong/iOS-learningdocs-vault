# openWindow

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

A window presentation action stored in a view’s environment.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
var openWindow: OpenWindowAction { get }
```

## Discussion

Use the `openWindow` environment value to get an [OpenWindowAction](../openwindowaction.md) instance for a given [Environment](../environment.md). Then call the instance to open a window. You call the instance directly because it defines a [callAsFunction(id:)](<../openwindowaction/callasfunction(id_).md>) method that Swift calls when you call the instance.

For example, you can define a button that opens a new mail viewer window:

```swift
@main
struct Mail: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup(id: "mail-viewer") {
            MailViewer()
        }
    }
}

struct NewViewerButton: View {
    @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow

    var body: some View {
        Button("Open new mail viewer") {
            openWindow(id: "mail-viewer")
        }
    }
}
```

You indicate which scene to open by providing one of the following:

- A string identifier that you pass through the `id` parameter, as in the above example.
- A `value` parameter that has a type that matches the type that you specify in the scene’s initializer.
- Both an identifier and a value. This enables you to define multiple window groups that take input values of the same type like a [UUID](../../foundation/uuid.md).

Use the first option to target either a [WindowGroup](../windowgroup.md) or a [Window](../window.md) scene in your app that has a matching identifier. For a `WindowGroup`, the system creates a new window for the group. If the window group presents data, the system provides the default value or `nil` to the window’s root view. If the targeted scene is a `Window`, the system orders it to the front.

Use the other two options to target a `WindowGroup` and provide a value to present. If the interface already has a window from the group that’s presenting the specified value, the system brings the window to the front. Otherwise, the system creates a new window and passes a binding to the specified value.
