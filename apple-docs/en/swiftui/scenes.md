# Scenes

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Declare the user interface groupings that make up the parts of your app.

## Overview

A scene represents a part of your app’s user interface that has a life cycle that the system manages. An [App](app.md) instance presents the scenes it contains, while each [Scene](scene.md) acts as the root element of a [View](view.md) hierarchy.

The system presents scenes in different ways depending on the type of scene, the platform, and the context. A scene might fill the entire display, part of the display, a window, a tab in a window, or something else. In some cases, your app might also be able to display more than one instance of the scene at a time, like when a user simultaneously opens multiple windows based on a single [WindowGroup](windowgroup.md) declaration in your app. For more information about the primary built-in scene types, see [Windows](windows.md) and [Documents](documents.md).

You configure scenes using modifiers, similar to how you configure views. For example, you can adjust the appearance of the window that contains a scene — if the scene happens to appear in a window — using the [windowStyle(_:)](<scene/windowstyle(__).md>) modifier. Similarly, you can add menu commands that become available when the scene is in the foreground on certain platforms using the [commands(content:)](<scene/commands(content_).md>) modifier.

- [Scene](scene.md) — A part of an app’s user interface with a life cycle managed by the system.
- [SceneBuilder](scenebuilder.md) — A result builder for composing a collection of scenes into a single composite scene.

### Monitoring scene life cycle

- [scenePhase](environmentvalues/scenephase.md) — The current phase of the scene.
- [ScenePhase](scenephase.md) — An indication of a scene’s operational state.

### Managing a settings window

- [Settings](settings.md) — A scene that presents an interface for viewing and modifying an app’s settings.
- [SettingsLink](settingslink.md) — A view that opens the Settings scene defined by an app.
- [OpenSettingsAction](opensettingsaction.md) — An action that presents the settings scene for an app.
- [openSettings](environmentvalues/opensettings.md) — A Settings presentation action stored in a view’s environment.

### Building a menu bar

- [menuBarExtraStyle(_:)](<scene/menubarextrastyle(__).md>) — Sets the style for menu bar extra created by this scene.
- [MenuBarExtraStyle](menubarextrastyle.md) — A specification for the appearance and behavior of a menu bar extra scene.

### Creating watch notifications

- [WKNotificationScene](wknotificationscene.md) — A scene which appears in response to receiving the specified category of remote or local notifications.
