# sizeDependent

<sub>Type Property</sub>

The size dependent preference allows the text to take the available space into account when choosing the size variant to display.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
static var sizeDependent: SizeDependentTextVariant { get }
```

## Discussion

When a [Text](../text.md) provides different size options for its content, the size dependent preference chooses the largest option that fits into the available space without truncating or clipping its content.

> [!note] Note
> Only use this option where needed as it incurs a performance cost on every [Text](../text.md) it is applied to, even if the concrete text initializer cannot provide multiple size variants and there is no visual impact.

## Difference to ViewThatFits

The [sizeDependent](sizedependent.md) text variant preference differs from [ViewThatFits](../viewthatfits.md) both in usage and in behavior. [ViewThatFits](../viewthatfits.md) chooses the first child where the **ideal** size fits the available space. For [Text](../text.md) this means that it will only choose texts that can fit their contents into the available space **without a line break**. With this text variant preference, on the other hand, the largest variant is chosen that can fit the available space while respecting all the regular layout rules, such as [lineLimit](../environmentvalues/linelimit.md).

To use [ViewThatFits](../viewthatfits.md), multiple different views have to be provided as the different size options. With this text variant preference, a single [Text](../text.md) provides the different size variants intrinsically. The way it generates these size variants and how many size variants are available depends on the text initializer used.
