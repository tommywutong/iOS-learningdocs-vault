# size(_:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of `size`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
nonisolated func size(_ size: CGSize) -> some Shape

```

### Transforming a shape

- [trim(from:to:)](<trim(from_to_).md>) — Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.
- [transform(_:)](<transform(__).md>) — Applies an affine transform to this shape.
- [size(_:anchor:)](<size(__anchor_).md>) — Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but within a rect of `size` instead of the container size.
- [size(width:height:)](<size(width_height_).md>) — Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size `(width, height)`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
- [size(width:height:anchor:)](<size(width_height_anchor_).md>) — Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but within a rect of `(width, height)` instead of the container size.
- [scale(_:anchor:)](<scale(__anchor_).md>) — Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
- [scale(x:y:anchor:)](<scale(x_y_anchor_).md>) — Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
- [rotation(_:anchor:)](<rotation(__anchor_).md>) — Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.
- [offset(_:)](<offset(__).md>) — Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
- [offset(x:y:)](<offset(x_y_).md>) — Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
