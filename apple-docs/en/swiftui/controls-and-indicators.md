# Controls and indicators

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Display values and get user selections.

## Overview

SwiftUI provides controls that enable user interaction specific to each platform and context. For example, people can initiate events with buttons and links, or choose among a set of discrete values with different kinds of pickers. You can also display information to the user with indicators like progress views and gauges.

Use these built-in controls and indicators when composing custom views, and style them to match the needs of your app’s user interface. For design guidance, see [Menus and actions](../design/human-interface-guidelines/menus-and-actions.md), [Selection and input](../design/human-interface-guidelines/selection-and-input.md), and [Status](../design/human-interface-guidelines/status.md) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
