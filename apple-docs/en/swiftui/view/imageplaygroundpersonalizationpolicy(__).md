# imagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy(_:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Policy determining whether to support the usage of people in the playground or not.

> [!warning] Deprecated
> Use imagePlaygroundOptions(_:) that takes ImagePlaygroundOptions.Personalization instead.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
nonisolated func imagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy(_ policy: ImagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy = .automatic) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `policy` — Policy determining whether personalization is enabled or not.

## Return Value

An image playground sheet that does or does not support personalization, based on the `enabled` flag.

## Discussion

Enabling people support will allow the user to condition image generation using:

- A person from their system Photos library
- A character represented by an appearance and a skin tone

Personalization options are available through several user interfaces, including:

- A people picker
- Detection of people names in the prompt text field
- Importing images containing people faces from the system photo library

Enabled by default when the modifier is not set or when the policy is set to `automatic`.
