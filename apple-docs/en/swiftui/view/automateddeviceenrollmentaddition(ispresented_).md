```

## Discussion

Use this view modifier to present UI in your app for device administrators to add devices purchased outside of the official channel to their organization — Apple School Manager or Apple Business. The system requires sign in with a Managed Apple Account that includes device enrollment privileges.

The following code example shows one way to present this view to your users:

Example Usage:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AutomatedDeviceEnrollment

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isAddingDevices: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Add Devices to Automated Device Enrollment") {
            isAddingDevices = true
        }
        .automatedDeviceEnrollmentAddition(isPresented: $isAddingDevices)
        .onChange(of: isAddingDevices) {
            if !isAddingDevices {
                // Handle dismiss action
            }
        }
    }
}
```
