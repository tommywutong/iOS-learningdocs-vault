# accessibilityAction(_:intent:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Adds an accessibility action representing `actionKind` to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as the VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action. When the action is performed, the `intent` will be invoked.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
nonisolated func accessibilityAction<I>(_ actionKind: AccessibilityActionKind = .default, intent: I) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier> where I : AppIntent
```
