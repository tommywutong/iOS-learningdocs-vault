# placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Assigns positions to each of the layout’s subviews.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func placeSubviews(in bounds: CGRect, proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Self.Subviews, cache: inout Self.Cache)
```

## Parameters

- `bounds` — The region that the container view’s parent allocates to the container view, specified in the parent’s coordinate space. Place all the container’s subviews within the region. The size of this region matches a size that your container previously returned from a call to the [sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)](<sizethatfits(proposal_subviews_cache_).md>) method.

- `proposal` — The size proposal from which the container generated the size that the parent used to create the `bounds` parameter. The parent might propose more than one size before calling the placement method, but it always uses one of the proposals and the corresponding returned size when placing the container.

- `subviews` — A collection of proxies that represent the views that the container arranges. Use the proxies in the collection to get information about the subviews and to tell the subviews where to appear.

- `cache` — Optional storage for calculated data that you can share among the methods of your custom layout container. See [makeCache(subviews:)](<makecache(subviews_).md>) for details.

## Discussion

SwiftUI calls your implementation of this method to tell your custom layout container to place its subviews. From this method, call the [place(at:anchor:proposal:)](<../layoutsubview/place(at_anchor_proposal_).md>) method on each element in `subviews` to tell the subviews where to appear in the user interface.

For example, you can create a basic vertical stack that places views in a column, with views horizontally aligned on their leading edge:

```swift
struct BasicVStack: Layout {
    func placeSubviews(
        in bounds: CGRect,
        proposal: ProposedViewSize,
        subviews: Subviews,
        cache: inout ()
    ) {
        var point = bounds.origin
        for subview in subviews {
            subview.place(at: point, anchor: .topLeading, proposal: .unspecified)
            point.y += subview.dimensions(in: .unspecified).height
        }
    }

    // This layout also needs a sizeThatFits() implementation.
}
```

The example creates a placement point that starts at the origin of the specified `bounds` input and uses that to place the first subview. It then moves the point in the y dimension by the subview’s height, which it reads using the [dimensions(in:)](<../layoutsubview/dimensions(in_).md>) method. This prepares the point for the next iteration of the loop. All subview operations use an [unspecified](../proposedviewsize/unspecified.md) size proposal to indicate that subviews should use and report their ideal size.

A more complex layout container might add space between subviews according to their [spacing](../layoutsubview/spacing.md) preferences, or a fixed space based on input configuration. For example, you can extend the basic vertical stack’s placement method to calculate the preferred distances between adjacent subviews and store the results in an array:

```swift
let spacing: [CGFloat] = subviews.indices.dropLast().map { index in
    subviews[index].spacing.distance(
        to: subviews[index + 1].spacing,
        along: .vertical)
}
```

The spacing’s [distance(to:along:)](<../viewspacing/distance(to_along_).md>) method considers the preferences of adjacent views on the edge where they meet. It returns the smallest distance that satisfies both views’ preferences for the given edge. For example, if one view prefers at least `2` points on its bottom edge, and the next view prefers at least `8` points on its top edge, the distance method returns `8`, because that’s the smallest value that satisfies both preferences.

Update the placement calculations to use the spacing values:

```swift
var point = bounds.origin
for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
    if index > 0 { point.y += spacing[index - 1] } // Add spacing.
    subview.place(at: point, anchor: .topLeading, proposal: .unspecified)
    point.y += subview.dimensions(in: .unspecified).height
}
```

Be sure that you use computations during placement that are consistent with those in your implementation of other protocol methods for a given set of inputs. For example, if you add spacing during placement, make sure your implementation of [sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)](<sizethatfits(proposal_subviews_cache_).md>) accounts for the extra space. Similarly, if the sizing method returns different values for different size proposals, make sure the placement method responds to its `proposal` input in the same way.
