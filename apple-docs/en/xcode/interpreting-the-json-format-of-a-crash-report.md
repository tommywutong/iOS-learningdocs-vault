# Interpreting the JSON format of a crash report

<sub>Article</sub>

Understand the structure and properties of the objects the system includes in the JSON of a crash report.

## Overview

Starting with iOS 15 and macOS 12, apps that generate crash reports store the data as JSON in files with an `.ips` extension. Tools for viewing these files, such as Console, translate the JSON to make it easier to read and interpret. The translated content uses field names the article [Examining the fields in a crash report](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md) describes. Use the following information to understand the structure of the JSON the system uses for these crash reports and how the data maps to the field names found in the translated content.

Typical JSON parsers expect a single JSON object in the body of the file. The IPS file for a crash report contains two JSON objects: an object containing IPS metadata about the report incident and an object containing the crash report data. When parsing the file, extract the JSON for the metadata object from the first line. If the `bug_type` property of the metadata object is `309`, the log type for crash reports, you can extract the JSON for the crash report data from the remainder of the text.

The following example reads the contents of a crash report into a dictionary:

```swift
    do {
        let content = try String(contentsOfFile: filePath, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)

        /// Read the first line, the metadata object, into a dictionary.
        let metadataRange = content.lineRange(for: ..<content.startIndex)
        let metadataJSON = content[metadataRange].data(using: .utf8)
        let metadata = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: metadataJSON!) as! Dictionary<String, Any>

        /// Check the `bug_type` property of the metadata for type `309`, the log type for crash reports.
        let logType = "\(metadata["bug_type"] ?? "(unknown)")"
        guard logType == "309" else {
            // Handle the error.        
            fatalError("Log type \(logType) is not a crash report.")
        }

        /// Read the remainder of the file, the crash report object, into a dictionary.
        let reportRange = content.lineRange(for: metadataRange.upperBound..<content.endIndex)
        let reportJSON = content[reportRange].data(using: .utf8)
        let report = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: reportJSON!) as! Dictionary<String, Any>

        return report
    } catch {
        // Handle the error.
        fatalError("*** An error occurred while reading the crash report: \(error.localizedDescription) ***")
    }
```

The crash report data is made up of additional objects pertaining to OS version, bundle, store, exception, termination, threads, frames, and binary images. The properties of all these objects are outlined below.

### IPS metadata

The IPS metadata object contains the following properties:

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | String | The name of the process the report applies to. Usually the process executable name. |
| `bug_type` | String | The identifier for the type of log captured by the report. Type `309` for the crash reports this article describes. You might encounter other types. Type `288`, for instance, is a stackshot. |
| `bundleID` | String | The bundle identifier of the process the report applies to; see [CFBundleIdentifier](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleidentifier.md). |
| `build_version` | String | The bundle version string of the process the report applies to; see [CFBundleVersion](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleversion.md). |
| `incident_id` | String | A unique identifier for the report. Two reports never share the same identifier. |

For details on how to use this information, see [Exception information](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md#Exception-information).

JSON stores numeric values as decimal numbers. The value the system stores in the `code` property is intended to be viewed in its hexadecimal form; see [Convert numeric values to hexadecimal numbers](interpreting-the-json-format-of-a-crash-report.md#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers).

### Threads

A report includes thread information in objects that can contain the following properties:

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `frames` | Array | An array of dictionaries describing each frame of the thread’s backtrace. Stack frames are in calling order, where frame 0 is the function that was executing at the time execution halted. Frame 1 is the function that called the function in frame 0, and so on. For a description of this object‘s properties, see [Frames](interpreting-the-json-format-of-a-crash-report.md#Frames). |
| `id` | Number | The thread’s index number. |
| `queue` | String | A string that identifies the dispatch queue of the crashing thread, if applicable. This appears in a translated report in the label above the backtrace of each thread under Dispatch Queue. |
| `threadState` | Dictionary | A JSON representation of the CPU registers and their values for the thread as well as other useful runtime data from when the process terminated. The structure and properties of this object depend on the `flavor`. This appears in its own section of the formatted report after the backtraces for all the threads. |
| `triggered` | Boolean | A Boolean with a `true` value if this thread is responsible for the crash. This appears in a translated report as Triggered by Thread. |

For details on how to use this information, see [Backtraces](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md#Backtraces) and [Thread state](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md#Thread-state).

JSON contains numbers for memory addresses in frame and thread state objects as decimal digits. To view the numbers contained in these fields in their more common hexadecimal form, see [Convert numeric values to hexadecimal numbers](interpreting-the-json-format-of-a-crash-report.md#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers).

### Frames

A report includes information about frames in objects with the following properties:

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `imageIndex` | Number | The index of the binary image containing the code this frame in the backtrace is executing. The object at this index in the `usedImages` array contains information about this image. For a description of this object‘s properties, see [Binary images](interpreting-the-json-format-of-a-crash-report.md#Binary-images). |
| `imageOffset` | Number | The byte offset from the start of the binary image to the current instruction. If you add this value to the `base` value from the binary images list, you’ll get the runtime memory address of the instruction that’s executing. For frame 0 in each backtrace, this is the address of the machine instruction executing on a thread when the process terminated. For other stack frames, this is the address of the first machine instruction that executes after control returns to that stack frame. This runtime memory address is the value that appears next to each frame in the backtraces of the formatted report. |
| `symbol` | String | In a fully symbolicated crash report, the name of the function that is executing. |
| `symbolLocation` | Number | The number of bytes from the executing instruction’s entry point. This is the value that appears after the ‘+’ next to each frame in the backtraces of the formatted report. |

For details on how to use this information, see [Backtraces](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md#Backtraces).

JSON contains numbers for the memory locations and offsets as decimal digits. To convert the numbers contained in these fields to their more common hexadecimal form, see [Convert numeric values to hexadecimal numbers](interpreting-the-json-format-of-a-crash-report.md#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers).

### Binary images

A report includes information about binary images loaded in the process at the time of termination in objects with the following properties:

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `arch` | String | The CPU architecture from the binary image that the operating system loaded into the process. |
| `base` | Number | The binary image’s load address. This is the start of the memory address range for the loaded image that appears in a translated report. |
| `name` | String | The binary name. |
| `path` | String | The path to the binary on disk. macOS replaces user-identifable path components with placeholder values to protect privacy. |
| `size` | Number | The size of the image. If you add this value to the `base` value, you’ll get the end of the memory address range for the loaded image that appears in a translated report. |
| `source` | String | A character that indicates the binary image’s region type: `P` (process), `S` (shared cache), `C` (shared cache library), `K` (kernel), `U` (kernel cache),  `T` (kernel text exec), `A` (absolute). |
| `uuid` | String | A build UUID that uniquely identifies the binary image you can use to locate the corresponding `dSYM` file when symbolicating the crash report. For more information, see [Building your app to include debugging information](building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information.md). |

For details on how to use this information, see [Binary images](examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report.md#Binary-images).

### Convert numeric values to hexadecimal numbers

JSON stores numeric values as decimal numbers. Many of these numeric values, such as error codes and memory addresses, appear in a translated report as hexadecimal numbers to make them easier to interpret.

You can use the following to print a hexadecimal representation of the numbers from the decimal representation found in the JSON.

```swift
import Foundation

let decimal = 2343432205

print(String(format: "0x%lx", decimal))
// Prints "0x8badf00d".
```
