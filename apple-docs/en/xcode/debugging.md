# Debugging

Identify and address issues in your app using the Xcode debugger, Xcode Organizer, Metal debugger, and Instruments.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Diagnosing and resolving bugs in your running app](diagnosing-and-resolving-bugs-in-your-running-app.md) — Inspect your app to isolate bugs, locate crashes, identify excess system-resource usage, visualize memory bugs, and investigate problems in its appearance.

### Debugging strategies

- [Diagnosing issues in the appearance of a running app](diagnosing-issues-in-the-appearance-of-your-running-app.md) — Inspect your running app to investigate issues in the appearance and placement of the content it displays.
- [Diagnosing memory, thread, and crash issues early](diagnosing-memory-thread-and-crash-issues-early.md) — Identify runtime crashes and undefined behaviors in your app during testing using Xcode’s sanitizer tools.
- [Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments](../foundation/analyzing-http-traffic-with-instruments.md) — Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.
- [Detecting when your app contacts domains that may be profiling users](detecting-when-your-app-contacts-domains-that-may-be-profiling-users.md) — Use Instruments to assess whether your app or its third-party SDKs connect to domains that may profile users.

### Graphics

- [Metal developer workflows](metal-developer-workflows.md) — Locate and fix issues related to your app’s use of the Metal API and GPU functions.
- [Metal debugger](metal-debugger.md) — Debug and profile your Metal workload with a GPU trace.

### Breakpoints and variables

- [Setting breakpoints to pause your running app](setting-breakpoints-to-pause-your-running-app.md) — Specify where your app pauses when running the debugger to investigate bugs.
- [Stepping through code and inspecting variables to isolate bugs](stepping-through-code-and-inspecting-variables-to-isolate-bugs.md) — Find the cause of your bugs by watching variables change as you step through your source code in the debugger.

### Reports

- [Building your app to include debugging information](building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information.md) — Configure Xcode to produce the symbol information for debugging and crash reports.
- [Diagnosing issues using crash reports and device logs](diagnosing-issues-using-crash-reports-and-device-logs.md) — Use crash reports and device logs to debug app issues.

### Entitlements

- [Diagnosing Issues with Entitlements](../bundleresources/diagnosing-issues-with-entitlements.md) — Verify your app’s entitlements at every stage of development to track down errors during distribution.

## See Also

### Tuning and debugging

- [Device Hub](device-hub.md) — Manage the simulated and physical devices that you use to test your app.
- [Performance and metrics](performance-and-metrics.md) — Measure, investigate, and address the use of system resources and issues impacting performance using Instruments and Xcode Organizer.
- [Testing](testing.md) — Develop and run tests to detect logic failures, UI problems, and performance regressions.
