# Misaligned pointer

<sub>Article</sub>

Detects when code accesses a misaligned pointer or creates a misaligned reference.

## Overview

In Xcode 9 and later, you can use this check to detect reads from, or writes to, a misaligned pointer, or when you create a misaligned reference. A pointer misaligns if its address isn’t a multiple of its type’s alignment. Dereferencing a misaligned pointer has undefined behavior, and may result in a crash or degraded performance.

Alignment violations occur frequently in code that serializes or deserializes data. Avoid this issue by using a serialization format that preserves data alignment.

### Misaligned integer pointer assignment in C

In the following example, the `pointer` variable must have 4-byte alignment, but has only 1-byte alignment:

```occ
int8_t *buffer = malloc(64);
int32_t *pointer = (int32_t *)(buffer + 1);
*pointer = 42; // Error: misaligned integer pointer assignment
```

#### Solution

Use an assignment function like `memcpy`, which can work with unaligned inputs.

```occ
int8_t *buffer = malloc(64);
int32_t value = 42;
memcpy(buffer + 1, &value, sizeof(int32_t)); // Correct
```

> [!note] Note
> The compiler can often safely optimize calls to `memcpy`, even for unaligned arguments.

### Misaligned structure pointer assignment in C

In the following example, the `pointer` variable must have 8-byte alignment, but has only 1-byte alignment:

```swift
struct A {
    int32_t i32;
    int64_t i64;
};
int8_t *buffer = malloc(32);
struct A *pointer = (struct A *)(buffer + 1);
pointer->i32 = 7; // Error: pointer is misaligned
```

#### Solution

One solution is to pack the structure. In the following example, the packed `A` structure prevents the compiler from adding padding between members:

```occ
struct A { ... } __attribute__((packed));
```
