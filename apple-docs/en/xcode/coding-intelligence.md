# Coding intelligence

Use agents to help you explore code, add features, refine your interface, and leverage skills, such as localization and accessibility.

## Overview

You interact with an agent or large language model of your choice by entering a series of natural language prompts to ask questions and give instructions. The agent or model refines its responses to your prompts based on previous interactions and any project context that you give it. Xcode presents the responses and changes that it makes to your project files for your review. You can enter another prompt or undo changes, and you can later roll back changes to a previous state. Xcode preserves all your interactions in conversations that you can refer to and organize into groups.

You can access Xcode intelligence from anywhere in your project, including the source editor, and it blends seamlessly into your workspace. The conversation sidebar behaves like the Project navigator. You can lay out and create tabs for the transcript and artifacts panes, similar to editor panes. You can arrange your workspace to run multiple agents in parallel while editing files in another pane.

Before you begin, set up an agent or model in Intelligence settings and choose it in the coding assistant sidebar. For more information, see [Setting up coding intelligence](setting-up-coding-intelligence.md).

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Setting up coding intelligence](setting-up-coding-intelligence.md) — Enable intelligence tools that you want to use in Xcode.
- [Writing code with intelligence in Xcode](writing-code-with-intelligence-in-xcode.md) — Start conversations with an agent or model in Xcode to generate code, navigate unfamiliar codebases, and fix or refactor existing code.
- [Using coding intelligence in the source editor](using-coding-intelligence-in-the-source-editor.md) — Submit prompts in the same place you want to make changes to your code.

### Skills and expertise

- [Localizing your app using agents](localizing-your-app-using-agents.md) — Use agentic coding tools to translate the strings in your app into multiple languages and regions.

### Agent configuration

- [Extending and customizing agents](extending-and-customizing-agents.md) — Expand agent capabilities for your specific needs and application domain.
- [Giving external agents access to Xcode](giving-external-agents-access-to-xcode.md) — Let agents access your project and Xcode capabilities using the Model Context Protocol.
