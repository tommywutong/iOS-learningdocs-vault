# Xcode Cloud

Automatically build, test, and distribute your apps with Xcode Cloud to verify changes and create high-quality apps.

## Overview

Xcode Cloud lets you adopt _continuous integration and delivery_ (CI/CD), a standard software development practice that helps you develop and maintain your code and deliver apps to testers and users. Xcode Cloud is a CI/CD system that combines the tools you use to create apps and frameworks for Apple platforms: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/), and [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com).

With Xcode Cloud, you can automatically and frequently:

- Build your project.
- Run tests and perform verifications.
- Distribute builds to testers and gather their feedback with [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) while protecting user privacy.

After successfully verifying a new version of your app with Xcode Cloud and TestFlight, you can quickly release it on the App Store.

For more information about continuous integration and delivery, see [About continuous integration and delivery with Xcode Cloud](about-continuous-integration-and-delivery-with-xcode-cloud.md). To learn more about configuring your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud, see [Configuring your first Xcode Cloud workflow](configuring-your-first-xcode-cloud-workflow.md).
