# Deallocation of nonallocated memory

<sub>Article</sub>

Detects attempts to free nonallocated memory.

## Overview

Use this check to detect when you call `free` on memory that you don’t allocate using `malloc`. Attempting to deallocate nonallocated memory can result in a crash. Available in Xcode 7 and later.

### Deallocation of a stack variable in C

In the following example, the `value` variable allocates on the stack, and deallocates when the function exits, so calling `free` on it is incorrect:

```occ
int value = 42;
free(&value); // Error: free called on stack allocated variable
```

#### Solution

Don’t call the `free` function on variables that you allocate on the stack.
