# Capabilities

Enable services that Apple provides, such as In-App Purchase, Push Notifications, Apple Pay, iCloud, and many others.

## Overview

Capabilities simplify the configuration process for many of Apple’s services, some of which require you to configure specific [Entitlements](../bundleresources/entitlements.md) or change your app’s provisioning profile. When you add a capability to an app or other target in your project, Xcode automatically configures that target to use the corresponding service. For example, Xcode might add a required entitlement to a new entitlements file and configure the project to use those entitlements. When Xcode needs you to provide additional information, it presents a simplified UI for you to specify that information.

> [!note] Note
> You add most capabilities directly from Xcode, but some app services — such as Game Center and In-App Purchase — require additional setup in App Store Connect and your developer account. For more information, see the documentation below for the specific capability.

Xcode automatically manages your target’s entitlements file based on the capabilities you add to that target. If you need to edit the file manually, see [Editing property list files](editing-property-list-files.md).
