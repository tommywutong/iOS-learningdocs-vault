# Understanding the exception types in a crash report

Learn what the exception type tells you about why your app crashed.

## Overview

The exception type in a crash report describes how the app terminated. It’s a key piece of information that guides how to investigate the source of the problem.

```other
Exception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
```

Crash reports record language exception information separately, including language exceptions thrown by an API or language features in Objective-C or C++.

## Topics

### Exceptions

- [EXC_ARITHMETIC](exc_arithmetic.md) — An arithmetic problem terminated the process, often because of division by zero or a floating-point error.
- [EXC_BAD_ACCESS](exc_bad_access.md) — A bad access to memory terminated the process.
- [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)](sigbus.md) — A bus error terminated the process, often because the process tried to access a misaligned or invalid address in memory, or due to a pointer authentication failure.
- [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)](sigsegv.md) — A memory segmentation fault terminated the process, often because the process tried to access an invalid or out-of-bounds address in memory.
- [EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) and EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)](sigtrap_sigill.md) — A trace trap or invalid CPU instruction interrupted the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.
- [EXC_CRASH](exc_crash.md) — The process crashed.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)](sigabrt.md) — The process terminated because it received an abort signal.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)](sigkill.md) — The operating system terminated the process, often because a background task violated a requirement, device resources were limited, or the user force quit the app.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)](sigquit.md) — Another processes terminated the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGSYS)](sigsys.md) — A bad argument to a system call terminated the process.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGTERM)](sigterm.md) — A software termination signal terminated the process.
- [EXC_GUARD](exc_guard.md) — The process violated a guarded resource protection, often related to file descriptors.
- [EXC_RESOURCE](exc_resource.md) — The operating system stopped the process because the process exceeded a limit on resource consumption, like CPU time or memory.
