# Metal developer workflows

Locate and fix issues related to your app’s use of the Metal API and GPU functions.

## Overview

Metal comes with a comprehensive suite of advanced developer tools to help you debug and optimize your Metal apps.

### Runtime diagnostics

You can enable API Validation when running your app to check for incorrect Metal API usage. For more information, see [Validating your app’s Metal API usage](validating-your-apps-metal-api-usage.md).

Enable Shader Validation when running your app to check for issues like out-of-bounds memory access, missing `useResource` calls, and stack overflows. For more information, see [Validating your app’s Metal shader usage](validating-your-apps-metal-shader-usage.md).

The Metal Performance HUD offers a visual overlay to catch performance issues while your app is running. For more information, see [Monitoring your Metal app’s graphics performance](monitoring-your-metal-apps-graphics-performance.md).

### Runtime performance analysis

The Metal system trace tool in Instruments provides a visual timeline of the parallel work on the CPU and the GPU, and the memory usage of your Metal app.

You can begin profiling with the Game Performance template (see [Analyzing the performance of your Metal app](analyzing-the-performance-of-your-metal-app.md)) or the Game Memory template (see [Analyzing the memory usage of your Metal app](analyzing-the-memory-usage-of-your-metal-app.md)).

### Advanced Metal debugging and profiling

The Metal debugger in Xcode provides advanced tools for debugging and profiling your Metal app.

You can get summaries of your Metal workload with the Dependencies viewer and the Memory viewer, inspect individual resources, and selectively debug your shaders. For more information on debugging, see [Investigating visual artifacts](investigating-visual-artifacts.md).

In addition, you can optimize your Metal app by drilling down performance bottlenecks with the Performance timeline and the per-line shader profiling results. For more information on profiling, see [Optimizing GPU performance](optimizing-gpu-performance.md).
