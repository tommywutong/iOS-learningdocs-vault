# Xcode command-line tool reference

<sub>Article</sub>

Use command-line tools that require you to install Xcode and set the app as the active developer directory.

## Overview

Xcode includes a set of command-line tools that only ship with the app, such as `devicectl`, `simctl`, and `xcodebuild`. You must install and set Xcode as the active developer directory before you can invoke these commands in Terminal.
