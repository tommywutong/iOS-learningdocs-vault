# Source control management

Back up your files, collaborate with others, and tag your releases with Git source control support in Xcode.

## Overview

_Source control_ is the practice of tracking and managing changes to your code. Manage your Xcode project with source control to keep a rich history of the changes you make, and collaborate on code faster and more effectively.

Xcode simplifies source control management with its built-in support for Git. You create a Git _source control repository_ that stores your project files and a history of your changes through _commits_. When a set of changes are ready, your reviewers verify them, make suggestions, and approve them. Then you can merge your changes into the repository.

For example, you create a branch for feature work, and after it’s approved, merge those changes into the main branch.
