# Performance and metrics

Measure, investigate, and address the use of system resources and issues impacting performance using Instruments and Xcode Organizer.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Improving your app’s performance](improving-your-app-s-performance.md) — Model, measure, and boost the performance of your app by using a continuous-improvement cycle.
- [Profiling apps using Instruments](../tutorials/instruments.md) — Use Instruments to analyze the performance, resource usage, and behavior of your apps. Learn how to improve responsiveness, reduce memory usage, and analyze complex behavior over time.
- [Analyzing the performance of your shipping app](analyzing-the-performance-of-your-shipping-app.md) — View power and performance metrics for apps you distribute through the App Store.
- [Creating a performance plan for your visionOS app](../visionos/creating-a-performance-plan-for-visionos-app.md) — Identify your app’s performance and power goals and create a plan to measure and assess them.

### Responsiveness

- [Analyzing responsiveness issues in your shipping app](analyzing-responsiveness-issues-in-your-shipping-app.md) — Identify responsiveness issues your users encounter, and use the hang and hitch data in Xcode Organizer to determine which issues are most important to fix.
- [Improving app responsiveness](improving-app-responsiveness.md) — Create a user experience that feels responsive by removing hangs and hitches from your app.
- [Understanding user interface responsiveness](understanding-user-interface-responsiveness.md) — Make your app more responsive by examining the event-handling and rendering loop.
- [Understanding and improving SwiftUI performance](understanding-and-improving-swiftui-performance.md) — Identify and address long-running view updates, and reduce the frequency of updates.
- [Understanding hangs in your app](understanding-hangs-in-your-app.md) — Determine the cause for delays in user interactions by examining the main thread and the main run loop.
- [Understanding hitches in your app](understanding-hitches-in-your-app.md) — Determine the cause of interruptions in motion by examining the render loop.
- [Diagnosing performance issues early](diagnosing-performance-issues-early.md) — Diagnose potential performance issues in your app during development and testing with the Thread Performance Checker tool in Xcode.
- [Reducing your app’s launch time](reducing-your-app-s-launch-time.md) — Create a more responsive experience with your app by minimizing time spent in startup.
- [Reducing terminations in your app](reduce-terminations-in-your-app.md) — Minimize how frequently the system stops your app by addressing common termination reasons.

### Processor usage

- [Addressing CPU bottlenecks](addressing-cpu-bottlenecks.md) — Locate and fix pipeline stalls, cache misses, and other performance issues.
- [Analyzing CPU usage with the Processor Trace instrument](analyzing-cpu-usage-with-processor-trace.md) — Identify code where your app uses the CPU inefficiently.
- [Analyzing CPU profiles with call tree views](analyzing-cpu-profiles-with-call-tree-views.md) — Use call tree visualizations to find performance bottlenecks in Instruments.

### Memory and size

- [Reducing your app’s memory use](reducing-your-app-s-memory-use.md) — Improve your app’s performance by analyzing memory-use metrics and making changes to maximize memory efficiency.
- [Reducing your app’s size](reducing-your-app-s-size.md) — Measure your app’s size, optimize its assets and settings, and adopt technologies that help streamline installation over a mobile internet connection.

### Graphics

- [Analyzing the performance of your Metal app](analyzing-the-performance-of-your-metal-app.md) — Ensure consistent, smooth rendering by profiling your app’s frame time.
- [Analyzing the memory usage of your Metal app](analyzing-the-memory-usage-of-your-metal-app.md) — Keep your app alive in the background by managing its memory footprint.

### Power

- [Analyzing your app’s battery use](analyzing-your-app-s-battery-use.md) — Increase the available use time for your app on a single battery charge by reducing your appʼs power consumption.
- [Measuring your app’s power use with Power Profiler](measuring-your-app-s-power-use-with-power-profiler.md) — Profile your app’s power impact whether or not your device is connected to Xcode.
- [Reducing your app’s battery use](reducing-your-app-s-battery-use.md) — Adopt design principles and recommended APIs to consume less power.

### Disk usage

- [Reducing disk writes](reducing-disk-writes.md) — Improve your app’s responsiveness by optimizing how it writes data to permanent storage.
- [Reducing your app’s disk usage](reducing-your-app-s-disk-usage.md) — Measure and minimize the space your app uses to store its files.
- [Monitoring your app’s storage metrics](monitoring-your-app-s-storage-metrics.md) — Track your app’s storage footprint over time using Xcode Organizer to catch regressions in Documents & Data and App Size.

### Network

- [Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments](../foundation/analyzing-http-traffic-with-instruments.md) — Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.

### Custom instruments

- [Creating custom modelers for intelligent instruments](creating-custom-modelers-for-intelligent-instruments.md) — Create Custom Modelers with the CLIPS language and learn how the embedded rules engine works.
