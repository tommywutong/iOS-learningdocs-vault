# Overflow and underflow of buffers

<sub>Article</sub>

Detects when you access memory outside of a buffer’s boundaries.

## Overview

In Xcode 7 and later, you can use this check to detect when you access memory that’s outside of a buffer’s boundaries. The check reports overflow when accessed memory is beyond the end of the buffer, and underflow when the accessed memory is before the beginning of a buffer. Xcode sanitizes heap and stack buffers, as well as global variables. Buffer overflow and underflow can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior.

### Global, heap, and stack overflows in C

In the following example, the `global_array`, `heap_buffer`, and `stack_buffer` variables each have valid indexes in the range `[0, 9]`, but the accessed index is `10`, which causes an overflow:

```occ
int global_array[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
void foo() {
    int idx = 10;
    global_array[idx] = 42; // Error: out of bounds access of global variable
    char *heap_buffer = malloc(10);
    heap_buffer[idx] = 'x'; // Error: out of bounds access of heap allocated variable
    char stack_buffer[10];
    stack_buffer[idx] = 'x'; // Error: out of bounds access of stack allocated variable
}
```

#### Solution

Add a bounds check before attempting to access a buffer at a specific index.
