# Creating width and device variants of strings

<sub>Article</sub>

Change a localized string for different interface widths and devices.

## Overview

> [!important] Important
> In Xcode 15 and later, use Dynamic Type instead of width variants and string catalogs to create device variants. For more information, see [Supporting multiple languages in your app](supporting-multiple-languages-in-your-app.md) and  [Localizing and varying text with a string catalog](localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog.md).

You can use a `.stringsdict` file to provide variants of a string for different view widths and for different devices. For example, display a different string for an iOS device in landscape or in portrait mode, or display a different string when your iPad app built with Mac Catalyst runs on a Mac.

A `.stringsdict` file is a property list that defines plural, width, and device variants of localizable strings. The `.stringsdict` file contains a dictionary of key-value pairs where the values are either a plural, width, or device rule.

The key for a rule is the string that you pass to [Text](../swiftui/text.md) structures, the [NSLocalizedString](../foundation/nslocalizedstring.md) macro, and similar APIs in your code. The rule can be a plural, width, or device rule that determines which formatted string the macro returns.

To create plural variants for formatted strings that contain amounts, see [Localizing strings that contain plurals](localizing-strings-that-contain-plurals.md).

### Add a strings dictionary file to your project

To add a `.stringsdict` file to your project, choose File \> New \> File from Template. In the sheet that appears, select the platform, enter `strings` in the Filter field, select Stringsdict File, and click Next. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for the file, choose a location, and click Create.

### Provide string variants for different widths

A _width rule_ specifies variants for different available widths in the user interface. It contains a single dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key in the dictionary is `NSStringVariableWidthRuleType` and the value is another dictionary with key-value pairs for each variant. The key for a variant is a width and the value is a string.

In the following `.stringsdict` file, for the `hello` string in the code, the width variations are `1`, `22`, and `53`, and the values are `Hi`, `Hello`, and `Greetings and Salutations`:

```other
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>hello</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSStringVariableWidthRuleType</key>
            <dict>
                <key>1</key>
                <string>Hi</string>
                <key>22</key>
                <string>Hello</string>
                <key>53</key>
                <string>Greetings and Salutations</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</plist>

```

For [UILabel](../uikit/uilabel.md) objects, the width is in em units that fit across the app window; otherwise, the width doesn’t have an associated unit.

The width rule defines variants for a range of widths:

- If the width is between two numerically sequential keys, the API returns the variant with the smaller key.
- If the width is less than all keys, the API returns the variant for the smallest key.

In the code above, if the width is `2`, the macro returns `Hi`. If the width is `52`, the macro returns `Hello`.

To get a variant for a specific width in your code, see the [variantFittingPresentationWidth(_:)](<../foundation/nsstring/variantfittingpresentationwidth(__).md>) method.

### Provide device-specific string variants

A _device rule_ specifies a different string depending on the device. For example, your universal app may present different instructions to the user when running on an iOS device than when running on a Mac.

A device rule contains a single dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key is `NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType` and the value is a dictionary with the following optional key-value pairs:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| appletv | The string to use on Apple TV. |
| applevision | The string to use on Apple Vision Pro. |
| applewatch | The string to use on Apple Watch. |
| ipad | The string to use on iPad. |
| iphone | The string to use on iPhone. |
| ipod | The string to use on iPod. |
| mac | The string to use on Mac. |

In the following `.stringsdict` file, when you pass `UserInstructions` as the string in your code, it returns `Tap here` when the app runs on an iPhone, `Click here` when it runs on a Mac, and `Press here` when it runs on an Apple TV:

```other
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>UserInstructions</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType</key>
        <dict>
            <key>iphone</key>
            <string>Tap here</string>
            <key>mac</key>
            <string>Click here</string>
            <key>appletv</key>
            <string>Press here</string>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```
