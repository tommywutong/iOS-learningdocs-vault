# CLLocationSourceInformation

<sub>Class</sub>

Information about the source that provides a location.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
class CLLocationSourceInformation
```

## Overview

[CLLocationSourceInformation](cllocationsourceinformation.md) contains information about the source that provides a [CLLocation](cllocation.md) instance, such as instances that [- locationManager:didUpdateLocations:](<cllocationmanagerdelegate/locationmanager(__didupdatelocations_).md>) delivers. For example, an app may choose to check the source information and reject locations if the [isSimulatedBySoftware](cllocationsourceinformation/issimulatedbysoftware.md) property is `true` when the developer isn’t debugging or testing the app.

## Relationships

- **Inherits From**: [NSObject](../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class.md)

- **Conforms To**: [CVarArg](../swift/cvararg.md), [CustomDebugStringConvertible](../swift/customdebugstringconvertible.md), [CustomStringConvertible](../swift/customstringconvertible.md), [Equatable](../swift/equatable.md), [Hashable](../swift/hashable.md), [NSCoding](../foundation/nscoding.md), [NSCopying](../foundation/nscopying.md), [NSObjectProtocol](../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol.md), [NSSecureCoding](../foundation/nssecurecoding.md)

## Topics

### Creating a location source information object

- [- initWithSoftwareSimulationState:andExternalAccessoryState:](<cllocationsourceinformation/init(softwaresimulationstate_andexternalaccessorystate_).md>) — Creates an instance of location source information.

### Identifying the source of location data

- [isProducedByAccessory](cllocationsourceinformation/isproducedbyaccessory.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the system receives the location from an external accessory.
- [isSimulatedBySoftware](cllocationsourceinformation/issimulatedbysoftware.md) — A Boolean value that indicates whether the system generates the location using on-device software simulation.

### Initializers

- [init(coder:)](<cllocationsourceinformation/init(coder_).md>)
