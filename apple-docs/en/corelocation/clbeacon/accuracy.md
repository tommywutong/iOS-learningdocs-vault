# accuracy

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

The accuracy of the proximity value, measured in meters from the beacon.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```swift
var accuracy: CLLocationAccuracy { get }
```

## Discussion

A beacon with a smaller value for accuracy is typically nearer than a beacon with a larger accuracy value.

Use this property to differentiate between beacons with the same proximity value. Do not use it to identify a precise location for the beacon. Accuracy values may fluctuate due to RF interference.

A negative value in this property signifies that the actual accuracy could not be determined.

### Determining the distance to the beacon

- [proximity](proximity.md) — The relative distance to the beacon.
- [CLProximity](../clproximity.md) — Constants that reflect the relative distance to a beacon.
- [rssi](rssi.md) — The received signal strength of the beacon, measured in decibels.
