# Metal debugging types

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Create capture managers and capture scopes, and review a GPU device’s log after it runs a command buffer.

## Topics

### Frame capture

- [MTLCaptureDescriptor](mtlcapturedescriptor.md) — A configuration for a Metal capture session.
- [MTLCaptureManager](mtlcapturemanager.md) — An instance you use to capture Metal command data in your app.
- [MTLCaptureDestination](mtlcapturedestination.md) — The kinds of destinations for captured command data.
- [MTLCaptureScope](mtlcapturescope.md) — A type that can programmatically customize a GPU frame capture.

### Capture errors

- [MTLCaptureError](mtlcaptureerror.md) — Errors returned by capture sessions.
- [MTLCaptureErrorDomain](mtlcaptureerrordomain.md) — The error domain for capture errors.

### Shader logs

- [MTLFunctionLog](mtlfunctionlog.md) — A log entry a Metal device generates when the it runs a command buffer.
- [MTLLogContainer](mtllogcontainer-swift.struct.md) — A collection of logged messages, created when a Metal device runs a command buffer.
