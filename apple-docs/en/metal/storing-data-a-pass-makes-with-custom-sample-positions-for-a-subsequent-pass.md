# Storing data a pass makes with custom sample positions for a subsequent pass

<sub>Article</sub>

Inform Metal when your app uses programmable sample positions for its depth render targets or copies MSAA depth data.

## Overview

A render or compute pass usually stores its target’s depth data in a compressed format. Any subsequent pass has to use the correct sample positions to decompress the data before reading it. You can store depth data in a representation that uses arbitrary sample positions (see [Positioning samples programmatically](positioning-samples-programmatically.md)).

> [!important] Important
> You can sample depth positions programmatically only on devices that support programmable sample positions (see [programmableSamplePositionsSupported](mtldevice/areprogrammablesamplepositionssupported.md)).

When your app uses custom sampling positions, inform Metal by setting the [MTLRenderPassColorAttachmentDescriptor](mtlrenderpasscolorattachmentdescriptor.md) or [MTLRenderPassDepthAttachmentDescriptor](mtlrenderpassdepthattachmentdescriptor.md) instance’s [storeActionOptions](mtlrenderpassattachmentdescriptor/storeactionoptions.md) property to [MTLStoreActionOptionCustomSamplePositions](mtlstoreactionoptions/customsamplepositions.md). This setting tells Metal that any subsequent pass that reads the attachment may not know the sample positions the current pass uses to generate the data. Examples of a pass that can use custom sample positions include the following:

- A fragment shader that uses unique, programmable sample positions
- A blit pass that copies MSAA depth data to another resource

In this scenario, Metal may decompress the depth render target and store the uncompressed data.

> [!tip] Tip
> Improve the performance of a pass if its programmable sample positions are the same for the next pass by setting the descriptor’s [storeAction](mtlrenderpassattachmentdescriptor/storeaction.md) property to [MTLStoreActionStore](mtlstoreaction/store.md) and clearing the [MTLStoreActionOptionCustomSamplePositions](mtlstoreactionoptions/customsamplepositions.md) option from the [storeActionOptions](mtlrenderpassattachmentdescriptor/storeactionoptions.md) property.
