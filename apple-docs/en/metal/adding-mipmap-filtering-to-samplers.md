# Adding mipmap filtering to samplers

<sub>Article</sub>

Specify how the GPU samples mipmaps in your textures.

## Overview

By default, samplers sample data only from mipmap `0`. If your texture contains more than one mipmap, and you want it to sample the lower-level mipmaps, you need to specify this behavior when you create the texture sampler.

### Create the sampler in your app

If you’re creating an [MTLSamplerState](mtlsamplerstate.md) instance, create the [MTLSamplerDescriptor](mtlsamplerdescriptor.md) instance and set its [mipFilter](mtlsamplerdescriptor/mipfilter.md) property. The following code uses linear filtering for the minification and magnification filter, and uses linear filtering for mipmaps. This combination is usually called _trilinear filtering_. With this configuration, the GPU chooses the two mipmaps nearest in size and generates a sample by linearly filtering four pixels from each mipmap. Then it blends those two values with a linear interpolation to generate the final sample.

**Swift**

```swift
let descriptor = MTLSamplerDescriptor()
descriptor.minFilter = MTLSamplerMinMagFilter.linear
descriptor.magFilter = MTLSamplerMinMagFilter.linear
descriptor.mipFilter = MTLSamplerMipFilter.linear

let sampler = device.makeSamplerState(descriptor: descriptor)
```

**Objective-C**

```objective-c
MTLSamplerDescriptor *descriptor = [MTLSamplerDescriptor new];
descriptor.minFilter = MTLSamplerMinMagFilterLinear;
descriptor.magFilter = MTLSamplerMinMagFilterLinear;
descriptor.mipFilter = MTLSamplerMipFilterLinear;

id<MTLSamplerState> sampler = [_device newSamplerStateWithDescriptor: descriptor];
```

Alternatively, any of these filters could filter from the nearest pixel, instead of a linear filter, resulting in fewer sampled pixels but lower quality. Ultimately, you need to decide the right tradeoffs between sampling performance and quality for your app.

### Create the sampler in your shader

If you prefer to create samplers in your shader, specify the mipmap filtering there instead of in your app:

```metal
constexpr sampler s(filter::linear, mip_filter::linear)
```
