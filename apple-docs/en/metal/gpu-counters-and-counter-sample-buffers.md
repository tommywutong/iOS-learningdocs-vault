# GPU counters and counter sample buffers

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Retrieve runtime data from a GPU device by sampling one or more of its counters.

## Overview

A GPU _counter_ ([MTLCounter](mtlcounter.md)) is typically a hardware feature that tracks a specific performance metric, such as timestamps before and after an important rendering stage. A _counter set_ ([MTLCounterSet](mtlcounterset.md)) is a collection of related counters. A _counter sample buffer_ ([MTLCounterSampleBuffer](mtlcountersamplebuffer.md)) represents the memory where a GPU device stores the data for a specific counter set.

You can retrieve and inspect data from a GPU’s counter set with the following steps:

1. Inspect which GPU counter sets a GPU device supports (see [Confirming which counters and counter sets a GPU supports](confirming-which-counters-and-counter-sets-a-gpu-supports.md)).
2. Make a counter sample buffer to store the data (see [Creating a counter sample buffer to store a GPU’s counter data during a pass](creating-a-counter-sample-buffer-to-store-a-gpus-counter-data-during-a-pass.md)).
3. Instruct the GPU to save the counter set data to the buffer during a pass or an immediate mode command (see [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers.md)).
4. Transform the counter set data into a standard type (see [Converting a GPU’s counter data into a readable format](converting-a-gpus-counter-data-into-a-readable-format.md)).

If you’re sampling data from a timestamp counter set ([MTLCommonCounterSetTimestamp](mtlcommoncounterset/timestamp.md)), you may need to convert the timestamps from the GPU’s clock to the CPU’s clock. See [Converting GPU timestamps into CPU time](converting-gpu-timestamps-into-cpu-time.md) for more information.

## Topics

### Counters and counter sets

- [Confirming which counters and counter sets a GPU supports](confirming-which-counters-and-counter-sets-a-gpu-supports.md) — Check whether a GPU produces the runtime performance data you want to sample.
- [MTLCounterSet](mtlcounterset.md) — A collection of individual counters a GPU device supports for a counter set.
- [MTLCommonCounterSet](mtlcommoncounterset.md) — The name of a specific counter set that a GPU device can support.
- [MTLCounter](mtlcounter.md) — An individual counter a GPU device lists within one of its counter sets.
- [MTLCommonCounter](mtlcommoncounter.md) — The name of a specific counter that can appear in a GPU device’s counter sets.

### Counter sample buffers

- [Creating a counter sample buffer to store a GPU’s counter data during a pass](creating-a-counter-sample-buffer-to-store-a-gpus-counter-data-during-a-pass.md) — Make a buffer that provides a place for a GPU to save its runtime performance metrics as it runs a pass.
- [MTLCounterSampleBufferDescriptor](mtlcountersamplebufferdescriptor.md) — A group of properties that configures the counter sample buffers you create with it.
- [MTLCounterSampleBuffer](mtlcountersamplebuffer.md) — A specialized memory buffer that stores a GPU’s counter set data.
- [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers.md) — Retrieve a GPU’s counter data at a time the GPU supports.
- [MTLCounterDontSample](mtlcounterdontsample.md) — A sentinel value that instructs an encoder to skip sampling a counter as the GPU runs the encoder’s pass.

### Counter sample data output

- [Converting a GPU’s counter data into a readable format](converting-a-gpus-counter-data-into-a-readable-format.md) — Inspect and use the data within a GPU’s counter sample buffer by resolving it into a standard format.
- [MTLCounterResultTimestamp](mtlcounterresulttimestamp.md) — The data structure for storing the data you resolve from a timestamp counter set.
- [MTLCounterResultStatistic](mtlcounterresultstatistic.md) — The data structure for storing the data you resolve from a statistic counter set.
- [MTLCounterResultStageUtilization](mtlcounterresultstageutilization.md) — The data structure for storing the data you resolve from a stage-utilization counter set.
- [MTLCounterErrorValue](mtlcountererrorvalue.md) — A sentinel value for an entry in a counter sample buffer that indicates the entry’s data is invalid.

### Timestamp data

- [Converting GPU timestamps into CPU time](converting-gpu-timestamps-into-cpu-time.md) — Correlate GPU events with CPU timelines by calculating the CPU time equivalents for GPU timestamps.
- [MTLTimestamp](mtltimestamp.md) — The number of nanoseconds for a point in absolute time or Mach absolute time.

### Counter sample buffer errors

- [MTLCounterSampleBufferError](mtlcountersamplebuffererror-swift.struct.md) — The error codes that indicate why a GPU driver can’t create a counter sample buffer.
