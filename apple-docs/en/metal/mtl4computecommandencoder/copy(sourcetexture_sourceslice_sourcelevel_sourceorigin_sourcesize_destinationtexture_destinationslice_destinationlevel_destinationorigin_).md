# copy(sourceTexture:sourceSlice:sourceLevel:sourceOrigin:sourceSize:destinationTexture:destinationSlice:destinationLevel:destinationOrigin:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Encodes a command that copies image data from a slice of a texture into a slice of another texture.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS</sub>

```swift
func copy(sourceTexture: any MTLTexture, sourceSlice: Int, sourceLevel: Int, sourceOrigin: MTLOrigin, sourceSize: MTLSize, destinationTexture: any MTLTexture, destinationSlice: Int, destinationLevel: Int, destinationOrigin: MTLOrigin)
```

## Parameters

- `sourceTexture` — An [MTLTexture](../mtltexture.md) texture that the command copies data from. To read the source texture contents, you need to set its [framebufferOnly](../mtltexture/isframebufferonly.md) property to [false](../../swift/false.md) prior to drawing into it.

- `sourceSlice` — A slice within `sourceTexture` the command uses as a starting point to copy data from. Set this to `0` if `sourceTexture` isn’t a texture array or a cube texture.

- `sourceLevel` — A mipmap level within `sourceTexture`.

- `sourceOrigin` — An [MTLOrigin](../mtlorigin.md) instance that represents a location within `sourceTexture` that the command begins copying data from. Assign `0` to each dimension that’s not relevant to `sourceTexture`.

- `sourceSize` — An [MTLSize](../mtlsize.md) instance that represents the size of the region, in pixels, that the command copies from `sourceTexture`, starting at `sourceOrigin`. Assign `1` to each dimension that’s not relevant to `sourceTexture`. If sourceTexture uses a compressed pixel format, set `sourceSize` to a multiple of the pixel format’s block size. If the block extends outside the bounds of the texture, clamp `sourceSize` to the edge of the texture.

- `destinationTexture` — Another [MTLTexture](../mtltexture.md) the command copies the data to that has the same [pixelFormat](../mtltexture/pixelformat.md) and [sampleCount](../mtltexture/samplecount.md) as `sourceTexture`. To write the contents into this texture, you need to set its [framebufferOnly](../mtltexture/isframebufferonly.md) property to [false](../../swift/false.md).

- `destinationSlice` — A slice within `destinationTexture` the command uses as its starting point for copying data to. Set this to `0` if `destinationTexture` isn’t a texture array or a cube texture.

- `destinationLevel` — A mipmap level within `destinationTexture`. The mipmap level you reference needs to have the same size as the `sourceTexture` slice’s mipmap at `sourceLevel`.

- `destinationOrigin` — An [MTLOrigin](../mtlorigin.md) instance that represents a location within `destinationTexture` that the command begins copying data to. Assign `0` to each dimension that’s not relevant to `destinationTexture`.
