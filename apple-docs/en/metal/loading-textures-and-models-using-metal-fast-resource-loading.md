# Loading textures and models using Metal fast resource loading

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Stream texture and buffer data directly from disk into Metal resources using fast resource loading.

## Overview

> [!note] Note
> This sample code project is associated with WWDC22 session [10104: Load resources faster with Metal 3](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10104/).

### Configure the sample code project

This sample code project requires the following:

- macOS 13 or later, and a Mac with Apple silicon
- Xcode 14 or later
