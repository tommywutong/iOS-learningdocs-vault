# Blit passes

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Encode a block information transfer pass to adjust and copy data to and from GPU resources, such as buffers and textures.

## Overview

Your app can use a block information transfer (blit) pass to manage data within, and copy data between, buffers, textures, and other Metal resources. Start by creating a blit command encoder by calling an [MTLCommandBuffer](mtlcommandbuffer.md) instance’s [- blitCommandEncoder](<mtlcommandbuffer/makeblitcommandencoder().md>) method. Then use the [MTLBlitCommandEncoder](mtlblitcommandencoder.md) instance’s methods to encode individual commands of your blit pass.

You also have the option to customize a blit pass’s runtime behavior, such as sampling GPU hardware data. To enable these options, configure an [MTLBlitPassDescriptor](mtlblitpassdescriptor.md) instance and pass it to the command buffer’s [- blitCommandEncoderWithDescriptor:](<mtlcommandbuffer/makeblitcommandencoder(descriptor_).md>) method. For more information about sampling GPU hardware data in a blit pass, see the articles in [GPU counters and counter sample buffers](gpu-counters-and-counter-sample-buffers.md), including:

- [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers.md)
- [Converting a GPU’s counter data into a readable format](converting-a-gpus-counter-data-into-a-readable-format.md)

## Topics

### Encoding a blit pass

- [MTLBlitCommandEncoder](mtlblitcommandencoder.md) — Encodes commands that copy and modify resources for a single blit pass.
- [MTLBlitOption](mtlblitoption.md) — The options that enable behavior for some blit operations.

### Configuring a blit command encoder

- [MTLBlitPassDescriptor](mtlblitpassdescriptor.md) — A configuration you create to customize a blit command encoder, which affects the runtime behavior of the blit pass you encode with it.
- [MTLBlitPassSampleBufferAttachmentDescriptor](mtlblitpasssamplebufferattachmentdescriptor.md) — A configuration that instructs the GPU where to store counter data from the beginning and end of a blit pass.
- [MTLBlitPassSampleBufferAttachmentDescriptorArray](mtlblitpasssamplebufferattachmentdescriptorarray.md) — A container that stores an array of sample buffer attachments for a blit pass.

- [Machine learning passes](machine-learning-passes.md) — Add machine learning model inference to your Metal app’s GPU workflow.
- [Indirect command encoding](indirect-command-encoding.md) — Store draw commands in Metal buffers and run them at a later time on the GPU, either once or repeatedly.
