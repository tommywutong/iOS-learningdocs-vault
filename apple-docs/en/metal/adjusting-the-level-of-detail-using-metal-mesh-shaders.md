# Adjusting the level of detail using Metal mesh shaders

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Choose and render meshes with several levels of detail using object and mesh shaders.

## Overview

> [!note] Note
> This sample code project is associated with WWDC22 session [10162: Transform your geometry with Metal mesh shaders](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10162/).

### Configure the sample code project

To run this sample, you need Xcode 14 or later, and a physical device that supports [MTLGPUFamilyMac2](mtlgpufamily/mac2.md) or [MTLGPUFamilyApple7](mtlgpufamily/apple7.md), such as:

- A Mac running macOS 13 or later
- An iOS device with an A15 chip or later running iOS 16 or later

This sample can only run on a physical device because it uses mesh shader features, which Simulator doesn’t support.
