# Customizing a PyTorch operation

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Implement a custom operation in PyTorch that uses Metal kernels to improve performance.

## Overview

> [!note] Note
> This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 10050: [Optimize machine learning for Metal apps](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10050).

### Configure the sample code project

Before you run the sample code project:

1. Follow the instructions in [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/).
2. Install PyTorch nightly (Python 3.7 or later is required).

```shell
pip3 install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

1. Install Ninja

```shell
pip3 install Ninja
```

1. Run the sample.

```shell
python3 run_sample.py
```
