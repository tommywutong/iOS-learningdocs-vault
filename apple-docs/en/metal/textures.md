# Textures

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Create and manage typed data your app uses to exchange information with its shader functions.

## Overview

[MTLTexture](mtltexture.md) instances can serve as input and output resources to shader functions, as well as render pass destinations, or _render attachments_. Unlike buffers, textures define the underlying pixel type and structure. Textures can:

- Store 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional data
- Contain several faces or layers
- Work as an array of texture data

Apps typically use textures to render details onto the surfaces in a scene or a 3D model. You can also use textures for post-processing pipelines, such as adding an advanced visual effect to an image before presenting it to a display.

Although textures can consume large amounts of memory, they also offer strategies, such as texture compression, that can save storage and memory bandwidth. Apple silicon GPUs support memoryless textures for transient render attachments that only need to exist for the duration of a render pass.

## Topics

### Texture basics

- [Understanding color-renderable pixel format sizes](understanding-color-renderable-pixel-format-sizes.md) — Know the size limits of color render targets in Apple GPUs based on the target’s pixel format.
- [Optimizing texture data](optimizing-texture-data.md) — Optimize a texture’s data to improve GPU or CPU access.
- [MTLTexture](mtltexture.md) — A resource that holds formatted image data.

### Texture mipmapping

- [Improving texture sampling quality and performance with mipmaps](improving-texture-sampling-quality-and-performance-with-mipmaps.md) — Avoid texture-rendering artifacts and reduce the GPU’s workload by creating smaller versions of a texture.
- [Creating a mipmapped texture](creating-a-mipmapped-texture.md) — Decide whether a texture that you’re creating needs mipmaps.
