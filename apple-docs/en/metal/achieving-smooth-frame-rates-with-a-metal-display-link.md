# Achieving smooth frame rates with a Metal display link

<sub>Sample Code</sub>

Pace rendering with minimal input latency while providing essential information to the operating system for power-efficient rendering, thermal mitigation, and the scheduling of sustainable workloads.

## Overview

> [!note] Note
> This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 10123: [Bring your game to Mac: Make a game plan](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10123/).
