# Improving texture sampling quality and performance with mipmaps

<sub>Article</sub>

Avoid texture-rendering artifacts and reduce the GPU’s workload by creating smaller versions of a texture.

## Overview

_Mipmaps_ are progressively smaller versions of the same texture image, each of which provides a different level of detail (LOD) for the texture. A texture’s _mipmap chain_ is its complete set of mipmaps. Textures with mipmaps can help your app eliminate common visual problems, such as aliasing and moire patterns, while reducing the GPU’s memory bandwidth.

__The largest version of a texture is mipmap `0` and it’s at the top of the mipmap chain. The next largest version is mipmap `1`, which is one level lower in the chain.

The six images on the right, labeled 1 through 6, are progressively smaller versions of the original texture where each mipmap level is 25% the size of the previous one.</sub>

Each nonzero mipmap level is 25% of the area of the previous mipmap level in the chain. A texture’s smallest mipmap is at least 1 pixel in each dimension.

A mipmapped texture gives the GPU the option to sample from a mipmap size that’s closest to the size of the primitive it’s rendering to. A GPU’s texture-sampling hardware works best when a texture’s dimensions are similar to the output primitive’s dimensions. Without mipmaps, the GPU can sample only the full-size texture, including when an output primitive is much smaller than the texture. In that scenario, the hardware typically fetches a significant portion of the texture to properly filter for color.

For example, to filter a 256 x 256 texture to an 8 x 8 rendering, the GPU needs to blend 25% of the texture for each output pixel. Additionally, you can’t precisely control which pixels the GPU fetches from the texture and then blends to render to a relatively small primitive. That imprecision can produce an obviously incorrect image, especially when it spans multiple frames, such as during animations.

In the upper right quadrant, the diagram highlights a square sample of the texture that’s 32 by 32 pixels. An arrow points from that square sample to the right to a smaller square. The smaller square is an output rendering of the larger texture, and is 8 by 8 pixels.</sub>

Mipmapped textures can also help improve your app’s performance because a GPU uses less memory bandwidth and memory cache by sampling from the smaller mipmaps.

You can create a mipmapped texture and initialize its mipmap chain by following the steps in [Creating a mipmapped texture](creating-a-mipmapped-texture.md) and [Generating mipmap data](generating-mipmap-data.md), respectively.
