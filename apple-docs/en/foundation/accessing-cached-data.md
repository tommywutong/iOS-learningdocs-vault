# Accessing cached data

<sub>Article</sub>

Control how URL requests make use of previously cached data.

## Overview

The URL Loading System caches responses both in memory and on disk, improving performance and reducing network traffic.

The [URLCache](urlcache.md) class is used for caching responses from network resources. Your app can directly access the shared cache instance by using the [sharedURLCache](urlcache/shared.md) property of `URLCache`. Or, you can create your own caches for different purposes, setting distinct caches on your [URLSessionConfiguration](urlsessionconfiguration.md) objects.

### Set a cache policy for URL requests

Each [URLRequest](urlrequest.md) instance contains a [CachePolicy](urlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.typealias.md) object to indicate if and how caching should be performed.  You can change this policy to control caching for the request.

For convenience, [URLSessionConfiguration](urlsessionconfiguration.md) has a property called [requestCachePolicy](urlsessionconfiguration/requestcachepolicy.md); all requests created from sessions that use this configuration inherit their cache policy from the configuration.

The behaviors of the various policies are described in doc:accessing-cached-data#Table-1. This table shows the policies’ respective preferences for loading from cache or from the originating source, like a server or the local file system. Currently, only HTTP and HTTPS responses are cached. For FTP and file URLs, the only effect of a policy is to determine whether the request is allowed to access the originating source.

| Cache policy | Local cache | Originating source |
|---|---|---|
| [NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData](nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/reloadignoringlocalcachedata.md) | Ignored | Accessed exclusively |
| [NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataDontLoad](nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/returncachedatadontload.md) | Accessed exclusively | Ignored |
| [NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad](nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/returncachedataelseload.md) | Tried first | Accessed only if needed |
| [NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy](nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/useprotocolcachepolicy.md) | Depends on protocol | Depends on protocol |

For an explanation of how `useProtocolCachePolicy` is implemented for HTTP and HTTPS, see [CachePolicy](nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum.md).  `useProtocolCachePolicy` is the default value for a `URLRequest` object.

> [!note] Note
> `useProtocolCachePolicy` caches HTTPS responses to disk, which may be undesirable for securing user data. You can change this behavior by manually handling caching behavior, as described in [Manage caching programmatically](accessing-cached-data.md#Manage-caching-programmatically).

### Access the cache directly

You can get or set the cache object used by a `URLSession` object by using the [URLCache](urlsessionconfiguration/urlcache.md) property of the session’s [configuration](urlsession/configuration.md) object.

To look for the cached response to a given request, call [- cachedResponseForRequest:](<urlcache/cachedresponse(for_).md>) on the cache. If cached data exists for the request, this call returns a [CachedURLResponse](cachedurlresponse.md) object; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

You can inspect resources used by the cache. The properties [currentDiskUsage](urlcache/currentdiskusage.md) and [diskCapacity](urlcache/diskcapacity.md) represent the file system resources used by the cache, and [currentMemoryUsage](urlcache/currentmemoryusage.md) and [memoryCapacity](urlcache/memorycapacity.md) represent memory use.

You can remove cached data for individual items with [- removeCachedResponseForRequest:](<urlcache/removecachedresponse(for_)-1dh89.md>). You can also clear out many cached items simultaneously with [- removeCachedResponsesSinceDate:](<urlcache/removecachedresponses(since_).md>), which removes cached items past a given date, or [- removeAllCachedResponses](<urlcache/removeallcachedresponses().md>), which wipes the entire cache.

### Manage caching programmatically

You can write to the cache programmatically, with the [- storeCachedResponse:forRequest:](<urlcache/storecachedresponse(__for_)-7p7bl.md>) method, passing in a new `CachedURLResponse` object and a `URLRequest` object.

Typically, you manage the caching of a response while it’s being handled by a `URLSessionTask` object. To manage caching on a per-response basis, implement the [- URLSession:dataTask:willCacheResponse:completionHandler:](<urlsessiondatadelegate/urlsession(__datatask_willcacheresponse_completionhandler_).md>) method of the [URLSessionDataDelegate](urlsessiondatadelegate.md) protocol. Note that this delegate method is called only for uploads and data tasks, and is not called for sessions with a background or ephemeral configuration.

The delegate receives two parameters: a `CachedURLResponse` object and a completion handler. Your delegate _must_ call this completion handler directly, passing in one of the following:

- The provided `CachedURLResponse` object, to cache the proposed response as-is
- `nil`, to prevent caching
- A newly created `CachedURLResponse` object, typically based on the provided object, but with a modified [storagePolicy](cachedurlresponse/storagepolicy.md) and [userInfo](cachedurlresponse/userinfo.md) dictionary, as you see fit

The following example shows an implementation of `urlSession(_:dataTask:willCacheResponse:completionHandler:)`, which intercepts responses to HTTPS requests and allows the responses to be stored in the in-memory cache only.

Handling the urlSession(_:dataTask:willCacheResponse:completionHandler:) callback

```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, dataTask: URLSessionDataTask,
                willCacheResponse proposedResponse: CachedURLResponse,
                completionHandler: @escaping (CachedURLResponse?) -> Void) {
    if proposedResponse.response.url?.scheme == "https" {
        let updatedResponse = CachedURLResponse(response: proposedResponse.response,
                                                data: proposedResponse.data,
                                                userInfo: proposedResponse.userInfo,
                                                storagePolicy: .allowedInMemoryOnly)
        completionHandler(updatedResponse)
    } else {
        completionHandler(proposedResponse)
    }
}
```
