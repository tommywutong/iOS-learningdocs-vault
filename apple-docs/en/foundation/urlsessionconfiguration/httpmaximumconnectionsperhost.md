# httpMaximumConnectionsPerHost

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

The maximum number of simultaneous connections to make to a given host.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
var httpMaximumConnectionsPerHost: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property determines the maximum number of simultaneous connections made to each host by tasks within sessions based on this configuration.

This limit is per session, so if you use multiple sessions, your app as a whole may exceed this limit. Additionally, depending on your connection to the Internet, a session may use a lower limit than the one you specify.

The default value is `6`.
