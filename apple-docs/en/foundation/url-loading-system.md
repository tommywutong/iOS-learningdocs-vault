# URL Loading System

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Interact with URLs and communicate with servers using standard Internet protocols.

## Overview

The URL Loading System provides access to resources identified by URLs, using standard protocols like `https` or custom protocols you create. Loading is performed asynchronously, so your app can remain responsive and handle incoming data or errors as they arrive.

You use a [URLSession](urlsession.md) instance to create one or more [URLSessionTask](urlsessiontask.md) instances, which can fetch and return data to your app, download files, or upload data and files to remote locations. To configure a session, you use a [URLSessionConfiguration](urlsessionconfiguration.md) object, which controls behavior like how to use caches and cookies, or whether to allow connections on a cellular network.

You can use one session repeatedly to create tasks. For example, a web browser might have separate sessions for regular and private browsing use, where the private session doesn’t cache its data. [Figure 1](/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system#2927983) shows how two sessions with these configurations can then create multiple tasks.

<sub>Figure showing two scenarios, default browsing and private browsing, each with a URL Session creating multiple URL Session Tasks. In the default browsing case, the URL Session contains a default configuration. In the private browsing case, it contains an ephemeral configuration.</sub>

Each session is associated with a delegate to receive periodic updates (or errors). The default delegate calls a completion handler block that you provide; if you choose to provide your own custom delegate, this block is not called.

You can configure a session to run in the background, so that while the app is suspended, the system can download data on its behalf and wake up the app to deliver the results.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Fetching website data into memory](fetching-website-data-into-memory.md) — Receive data directly into memory by creating a data task from a URL session.
- [Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments](analyzing-http-traffic-with-instruments.md) — Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.
- [URLSession](urlsession.md) — An object that coordinates a group of related, network data transfer tasks.
- [URLSessionTask](urlsessiontask.md) — A task, like downloading a specific resource, performed in a URL session.

### Requests and responses

- [URLRequest](urlrequest.md) — A URL load request that is independent of protocol or URL scheme.
- [NSURLRequest](nsurlrequest.md) — A URL load request that is independent of protocol or URL scheme.
- [NSMutableURLRequest](nsmutableurlrequest.md) — A mutable URL load request that is independent of protocol or URL scheme.
- [URLResponse](urlresponse.md) — The metadata associated with the response to a URL load request, independent of protocol and URL scheme.
- [HTTPURLResponse](httpurlresponse.md) — The metadata associated with the response to an HTTP protocol URL load request.

### Uploading

- [Building a resumable upload server with SwiftNIO](building-a-resumable-upload-server-with-swiftnio.md) — Support HTTP resumable upload protocol in SwiftNIO by translating resumable uploads to regular uploads.
- [Uploading data to a website](uploading-data-to-a-website.md) — Post data from your app to servers.
- [Uploading streams of data](uploading-streams-of-data.md) — Send a stream of data to a server.
- [Pausing and resuming uploads](pausing-and-resuming-uploads.md) — Pause and resume an upload without starting over, even when the connection is interrupted.

### Downloading

- [Downloading files from websites](downloading-files-from-websites.md) — Download files directly to the filesystem.
- [Pausing and resuming downloads](pausing-and-resuming-downloads.md) — Allow the user to resume a download without starting over.
- [Downloading files in the background](downloading-files-in-the-background.md) — Create tasks that download files while your app is inactive.

### Cache behavior

- [Accessing cached data](accessing-cached-data.md) — Control how URL requests make use of previously cached data.
- [CachedURLResponse](cachedurlresponse.md) — A cached response to a URL request.
- [URLCache](urlcache.md) — An object that maps URL requests to cached response objects.

### Authentication and credentials

- [Handling an authentication challenge](handling-an-authentication-challenge.md) — Respond appropriately when a server demands authentication for a URL request.
- [URLAuthenticationChallenge](urlauthenticationchallenge.md) — A challenge from a server requiring authentication from the client.
- [URLCredential](urlcredential.md) — `A`n authentication credential consisting of information specific to the type of credential and the type of persistent storage to use, if any.
- [URLCredentialStorage](urlcredentialstorage.md) — The manager of a shared credentials cache.
- [URLProtectionSpace](urlprotectionspace.md) — A server or an area on a server, commonly referred to as a realm, that requires authentication.

### Network activity attribution

- [Inspecting app activity data](../network/inspecting-app-activity-data.md) — Verify that your app accesses only the user data and network resources that you expect it to access.
- [Indicating the source of network activity](../network/indicating-the-source-of-network-activity.md) — Control whether the App Privacy Report attributes network traffic to the app or to the user.

### Cookies

- [HTTPCookie](httpcookie.md) — A representation of an HTTP cookie.
- [HTTPCookieStorage](httpcookiestorage.md) — A container that manages the storage of cookies.

### Errors

- [URLError](urlerror.md) — Error codes returned by URL loading APIs.
- [URL Loading System error info keys](url-loading-system-error-info-keys.md) — Recognize these keys from the user info dictionary of error objects produced by URL Loading APIs.

### Legacy

- [Legacy URL Loading Systems](legacy-url-loading-systems.md) — Migrate your code away from using these legacy objects.
