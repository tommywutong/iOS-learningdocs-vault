# NSInvocation

<sub>Class</sub>

An Objective-C message rendered as an object.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
@interface NSInvocation : NSObject
```

## Overview

[NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) objects are used to store and forward messages between objects and between applications, primarily by [Timer](timer.md) objects and the distributed objects system. An [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) object contains all the elements of an Objective-C message: a target, a selector, arguments, and the return value. Each of these elements can be set directly, and the return value is set automatically when the [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) object is dispatched.

An [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) object can be repeatedly dispatched to different targets; its arguments can be modified between dispatch for varying results; even its selector can be changed to another with the same method signature (argument and return types). This flexibility makes [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) useful for repeating messages with many arguments and variations; rather than retyping a slightly different expression for each message, you modify the [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) object as needed each time before dispatching it to a new target.

[NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) does not support invocations of methods with either variable numbers of arguments or `union` arguments. You should use the [invocationWithMethodSignature:](nsinvocation/invocationwithmethodsignature_.md) class method to create [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) objects; you should not create these objects using [alloc](../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/alloc.md) and [init()](<../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/init().md>).

This class does not retain the arguments for the contained invocation by default. If those objects might disappear between the time you create your instance of [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) and the time you use it, you should explicitly retain the objects yourself or invoke the [retainArguments](nsinvocation/retainarguments.md) method to have the invocation object retain them itself.

> [!note] Note
> [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) conforms to the [NSCoding](nscoding.md) protocol, but only supports coding by an [NSPortCoder](nsportcoder.md). [NSInvocation](nsinvocation.md) does not support archiving.

## Relationships

- **Inherits From**: [NSObject](../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class.md)

## Topics

### Creating NSInvocation Objects

- [invocationWithMethodSignature:](nsinvocation/invocationwithmethodsignature_.md) — Returns an `NSInvocation` object able to construct messages using a given method signature.

### Configuring an Invocation Object

- [selector](nsinvocation/selector.md) — The receiver’s selector, or 0 if it hasn’t been set.
- [target](nsinvocation/target.md) — The receiver’s target, or `nil` if the receiver has no target.
- [setArgument:atIndex:](nsinvocation/setargument_atindex_.md) — Sets an argument of the receiver.
- [getArgument:atIndex:](nsinvocation/getargument_atindex_.md) — Returns by indirection the receiver’s argument at a specified index.
- [argumentsRetained](nsinvocation/argumentsretained.md) — A Boolean value that indicates if the receiver has retained its arguments.
- [retainArguments](nsinvocation/retainarguments.md) — If the receiver hasn’t already done so, retains the target and all object arguments of the receiver and copies all of its C-string arguments and blocks. If a returnvalue has been set, this is also retained or copied.
- [setReturnValue:](nsinvocation/setreturnvalue_.md) — Sets the receiver’s return value.
- [getReturnValue:](nsinvocation/getreturnvalue_.md) — Gets the invocation’s return value.

### Dispatching an Invocation

- [invoke](nsinvocation/invoke.md) — Sends the receiver’s message (with arguments) to its target and sets the return value.
- [invokeWithTarget:](nsinvocation/invokewithtarget_.md) — Sets the receiver’s target, sends the receiver’s message (with arguments) to that target, and sets the return value.

### Getting the Method Signature

- [methodSignature](nsinvocation/methodsignature.md) — The receiver’s method signature.

### Instance Methods

- [invokeUsingIMP:](nsinvocation/invokeusingimp_.md)

## See Also

### Invocations

- [NSMethodSignature](nsmethodsignature.md) — A record of the type information for the return value and parameters of a method.
