# URLByResolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeToURL:bookmarkDataIsStale:error:

<sub>Type Method</sub>

Returns a new URL made by resolving bookmark data.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
+ (instancetype) URLByResolvingBookmarkData:(NSData *) bookmarkData options:(NSURLBookmarkResolutionOptions) options relativeToURL:(NSURL *) relativeURL bookmarkDataIsStale:(BOOL *) isStale error:(NSError **) error;
```

## Parameters

- `bookmarkData` — The bookmark data the URL is derived from.

- `options` — Options taken into account when resolving the bookmark data. To resolve a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, you must include (by way of bitwise `OR` operators with any other options in this parameter) the [NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithSecurityScope](bookmarkresolutionoptions/withsecurityscope.md) option.

- `relativeURL` — The base URL that the bookmark data is relative to. If you are resolving a security-scoped bookmark to obtain a security-scoped URL, use this parameter as follows: - To resolve an app-scoped bookmark, use a value of `nil`. - To resolve a document-scoped bookmark, use the _absolute_ path (despite this parameter’s name) to the document from which you retrieved the bookmark. App Sandbox does not restrict which URL values may be passed to this parameter.

- `isStale` — On return, if [true](../../swift/true.md), the bookmark data is stale. Your app should create a new bookmark using the returned URL and use it in place of any stored copies of the existing bookmark.

- `error` — The error that occurred in the case that the URL cannot be created.

## Return Value

A new URL made by resolving `bookmarkData`.

## Discussion

This method fails if the original file or directory could not be located or is on a volume that could not be mounted. If this method fails, you can use the [+ resourceValuesForKeys:fromBookmarkData:](<resourcevalues(forkeys_frombookmarkdata_).md>) method to obtain information about the bookmark, such as the last known path ([NSURLPathKey](../urlresourcekey/pathkey.md)) to help the user decide how to proceed.

To obtain a security-scoped URL from a security-scoped bookmark, call this method using the [NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithSecurityScope](bookmarkresolutionoptions/withsecurityscope.md) option. In addition, to use security scope, you must first have enabled the appropriate entitlements for your app, as described in [Enabling Security-Scoped Bookmark and URL Access](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW18).

To then obtain access to the file-system resource pointed to by a security-scoped URL (in other words, to bring the resource into your app’s sandbox), call the [- startAccessingSecurityScopedResource](<startaccessingsecurityscopedresource().md>) method (or its Core Foundation equivalent, the [CFURLStartAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_:)](<../../corefoundation/cfurlstartaccessingsecurityscopedresource(__).md>) function) on the URL.

For an app-scoped bookmark, no sandboxed app other than the one that created the bookmark can obtain access to the file-system resource that the URL (obtained from the bookmark) points to.

For a document-scoped bookmark, any sandboxed app that has access to the bookmark data itself, and has access to the document that owns the bookmark, can obtain access to the resource.

> [!note] Version note
> Security-scoped bookmarks are not available in versions of macOS prior to OS X v10.7.3.
