# NSURLErrorUserCancelledAuthentication

<sub>Enumeration Case</sub>

An asynchronous request for authentication has been canceled by the user.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
NSURLErrorUserCancelledAuthentication
```

## Discussion

This is typically incurred by clicking a “Cancel” button in a username/password dialog, rather than the user making an attempt to authenticate.
