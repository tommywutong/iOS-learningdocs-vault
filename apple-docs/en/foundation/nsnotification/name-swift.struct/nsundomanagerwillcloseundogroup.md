# NSUndoManagerWillCloseUndoGroup

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
static let NSUndoManagerWillCloseUndoGroup: NSNotification.Name
```

## Discussion

This notification originates in the implementation of the [- endUndoGrouping](<../../undomanager/endundogrouping().md>) method.

The notification object is the [UndoManager](../../undomanager.md) object. Prior to OS X v10.7 this notification didn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary. In macOS 10.7 and later the userInfo dictionary may contain the [NSUndoManagerWillCloseUndoGroupNotification](nsundomanagerwillcloseundogroup.md) key, with a `NSNumber` Boolean value of YES, if the undo group as a whole is discardable.

The system posts this notification on the actor, thread, or dispatch queue that calls [- endUndoGrouping](<../../undomanager/endundogrouping().md>).
