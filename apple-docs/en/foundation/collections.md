# Collections

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Use arrays, dictionaries, sets, and specialized collections to store and iterate groups of objects or values.

## Topics

### Basic Collections

- [Array](../swift/array.md) — An ordered, random-access collection.
- [Dictionary](../swift/dictionary.md) — A collection whose elements are key-value pairs.
- [Set](../swift/set.md) — An unordered collection of unique elements.

### Indexes

- [IndexPath](indexpath.md) — A list of indexes that together represent the path to a specific location in a tree of nested arrays.
- [IndexSet](indexset.md) — A collection of unique integer values that represent the indexes of elements in another collection.

### Specialized Sets

- [NSCountedSet](nscountedset.md) — A mutable, unordered collection of distinct objects that may appear more than once in the collection.
- [NSOrderedSet](nsorderedset.md) — A static, ordered collection of unique objects.
- [NSMutableOrderedSet](nsmutableorderedset.md) — A dynamic, ordered collection of unique objects.

### Purgeable Collections

- [NSCache](nscache.md) — A mutable collection you use to temporarily store transient key-value pairs that are subject to eviction when resources are low.
- [NSPurgeableData](nspurgeabledata.md) — A mutable data object containing bytes that can be discarded when they’re no longer needed.

### Pointer Collections

- [NSPointerArray](nspointerarray.md) — A collection similar to an array, but with a broader range of available memory semantics.
- [NSMapTable](nsmaptable.md) — A collection similar to a dictionary, but with a broader range of available memory semantics.
- [NSHashTable](nshashtable.md) — A collection similar to a set, but with broader range of available memory semantics.

### Iteration

- [NSEnumerator](nsenumerator.md) — An abstract class whose subclasses enumerate collections of objects, such as arrays and dictionaries.
- [NSFastEnumeration](nsfastenumeration.md) — A protocol that objects adopt to support fast enumeration.
- [NSFastEnumerationIterator](nsfastenumerationiterator.md)
- [NSIndexSetIterator](nsindexsetiterator.md) — An iterator suitable for enumerating the elements of an index set.
- [NSEnumerationOptions](nsenumerationoptions.md) — Options for block enumeration operations.
- [NSSortOptions](nssortoptions.md) — Options for block sorting operations.

### Special Semantic Values

- [NSNull](nsnull.md) — A singleton object used to represent null values in collection objects that don’t allow `nil` values.
- [NSNotFound](nsnotfound-9t5v2.md)
- [NSNotFound](nsnotfound-4qp9h.md) — A value indicating that a requested item couldn’t be found or doesn’t exist.

- [Strings and Text](strings-and-text.md) — Create and process strings of Unicode characters, use regular expressions to find patterns, and perform natural language analysis of text.
- [Dates and Times](dates-and-times.md) — Compare dates and times, and perform calendar and time zone calculations.
- [Units and Measurement](units-and-measurement.md) — Label numeric quantities with physical dimensions to allow locale-aware formatting and conversion between related units.
- [Data Formatting](data-formatting.md) — Convert numbers, dates, measurements, and other values to and from locale-aware string representations.
- [Filters and Sorting](filters-and-sorting.md) — Use predicates, expressions, and sort descriptors to examine elements in collections and other services.
