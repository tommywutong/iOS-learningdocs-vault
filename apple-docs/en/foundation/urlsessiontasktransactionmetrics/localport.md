# localPort

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

The port number of the local interface for the connection.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
var localPort: Int? { get }
```

## Discussion

For multipath protocols, this is the local port of the initial flow. If the app didn’t use the connection, this value is `nil`.
