# HTTPCookieStorage

<sub>Class</sub>

A container that manages the storage of cookies.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
class HTTPCookieStorage
```

## Overview

Each stored cookie is represented by an instance of the [HTTPCookie](httpcookie.md) class.

### Sharing cookie storage

The persistent cookie storage returned by [sharedHTTPCookieStorage](httpcookiestorage/shared.md) may be available to app extensions or other apps, subject to the following guidelines:

- iOS — Each app and app extension has a unique data container, meaning  they have separate cookie stores. You can obtain a common cookie storage by using the [+ sharedCookieStorageForGroupContainerIdentifier:](<httpcookiestorage/sharedcookiestorage(forgroupcontaineridentifier_).md>) method.
- macOS (non-sandboxed) — As of macOS 10.11, each app has its own cookie storage. Prior to macOS 10.11, a common cookie store is shared among the user’s apps.
- macOS (sandboxed) — Same as iOS.
- [UIWebView](../uikit/uiwebview.md) — `UIWebView` instances within an app inherit the parent app’s shared cookie storage.
- [WKWebView](../webkit/wkwebview.md) — Each `WKWebView` instance has its own cookie storage. See the [WKHTTPCookieStore](../webkit/wkhttpcookiestore.md) class for more information.

Session cookies (where the cookie object’s [sessionOnly](httpcookie/issessiononly.md) property is [true](../swift/true.md)) are local to a single process and are not shared.

> [!note] Note
> In cases where a cookie storage is shared between processes, changes made to the cookie accept policy affect all currently running apps using the cookie storage.

### Subclassing notes

The [HTTPCookieStorage](httpcookiestorage.md) class is usable as-is, but you can subclass it. For example, you can override the storage methods like [- storeCookies:forTask:](<httpcookiestorage/storecookies(__for_).md>), [- getCookiesForTask:completionHandler:](<httpcookiestorage/getcookiesfor(__completionhandler_).md>) to screen which cookies are stored, or reimplement the storage mechanism for security or other reasons.

When overriding methods of this class, be aware that methods that take a `task` parameter are preferred by the system to equivalent methods that do not. Therefore, you should override the task-based methods when subclassing, as follows:

- Retrieving cookies — Override [- getCookiesForTask:completionHandler:](<httpcookiestorage/getcookiesfor(__completionhandler_).md>), instead of or in addition to [- cookiesForURL:](<httpcookiestorage/cookies(for_).md>).
- Adding cookies — Override [- storeCookies:forTask:](<httpcookiestorage/storecookies(__for_).md>), instead of or in addition to [- setCookies:forURL:mainDocumentURL:](<httpcookiestorage/setcookies(__for_maindocumenturl_).md>).

## Topics

### Getting the shared cookie storage object

- [sharedHTTPCookieStorage](httpcookiestorage/shared.md) — The shared cookie storage instance.
- [+ sharedCookieStorageForGroupContainerIdentifier:](<httpcookiestorage/sharedcookiestorage(forgroupcontaineridentifier_).md>) — Returns the cookie storage instance for the container associated with the specified app group identifier.

### Getting and setting the cookie accept policy

- [cookieAcceptPolicy](httpcookiestorage/cookieacceptpolicy.md) — The cookie storage’s cookie accept policy.
- [AcceptPolicy](httpcookie/acceptpolicy.md) — Cookie acceptance policies implemented by the [HTTPCookieStorage](httpcookiestorage.md) class.

### Adding and removing cookies

- [- removeCookiesSinceDate:](<httpcookiestorage/removecookies(since_).md>) — Removes cookies that were stored after a given date.
- [- deleteCookie:](<httpcookiestorage/deletecookie(__).md>) — Deletes the specified cookie from the cookie storage.
- [- setCookie:](<httpcookiestorage/setcookie(__).md>) — Stores a specified cookie in the cookie storage if the cookie accept policy permits.
- [- setCookies:forURL:mainDocumentURL:](<httpcookiestorage/setcookies(__for_maindocumenturl_).md>) — Adds an array of cookies to the cookie storage if the storage’s cookie acceptance policy permits.
- [- storeCookies:forTask:](<httpcookiestorage/storecookies(__for_).md>) — Stores an array of cookies in the cookie storage, on behalf of the provided task, if the cookie accept policy permits.

### Retrieving cookies

- [cookies](httpcookiestorage/cookies.md) — The cookie storage’s cookies.
- [- getCookiesForTask:completionHandler:](<httpcookiestorage/getcookiesfor(__completionhandler_).md>) — Fetches cookies relevant to the specified task and passes them to the completion handler.
- [- cookiesForURL:](<httpcookiestorage/cookies(for_).md>) — Returns all the cookie storage’s cookies that are sent to a specified URL.
- [- sortedCookiesUsingDescriptors:](<httpcookiestorage/sortedcookies(using_).md>) — Returns all of the cookie storage’s cookies, sorted according to a given set of sort descriptors.

### Tracking cookie storage changes

- [NSHTTPCookieManagerCookiesChangedNotification](nsnotification/name-swift.struct/nshttpcookiemanagercookieschanged.md) — A notification posted when the cookies stored in the cookie storage have changed.
- [CookiesChangedMessage](httpcookiestorage/cookieschangedmessage.md) — A message a cookie storage instance sends when its cookies change.
- [NSHTTPCookieManagerAcceptPolicyChangedNotification](nsnotification/name-swift.struct/nshttpcookiemanageracceptpolicychanged.md) — A notification posted when the acceptance policy of the cookie storage has changed. _(deprecated)_
