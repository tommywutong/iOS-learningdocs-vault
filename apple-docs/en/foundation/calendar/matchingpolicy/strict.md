# Calendar.MatchingPolicy.strict

<sub>Case</sub>

If specified, the algorithm travels as far forward or backward as necessary looking for a match.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
case strict
```

## Discussion

For example, if searching for Feb 29 in the Gregorian calendar, the algorithm may choose March 1 instead (for example, if the year is not a leap year). If you wish to find the next Feb 29 without the algorithm adjusting the next higher component in the specified `DateComponents`, then use the `strict` option.

> [!note] Note
> There are ultimately implementation-defined limits in how far distant the search will go.

### Enumeration Cases

- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.nextTime](nexttime.md) — If there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the algorithm will return the next existing time which exists.
- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.nextTimePreservingSmallerComponents](nexttimepreservingsmallercomponents.md) — If specified, and there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the method returns the next existing value of the missing component and preserves the lower components’ values (for example, no 2:37am results in 3:37am, if that exists).
- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.previousTimePreservingSmallerComponents](previoustimepreservingsmallercomponents.md) — If there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the algorithm will return the previous existing value of the missing component and preserves the lower components’ values.
