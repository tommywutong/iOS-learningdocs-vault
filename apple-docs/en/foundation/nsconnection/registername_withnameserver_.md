# registerName:withNameServer:

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Registers a service with the specified port name server.

<sub>Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```objc
- (BOOL) registerName:(NSString *) name withNameServer:(NSPortNameServer *) server;
```

## Parameters

- `name` — The name under which to register the receiver.

- `server` — The name server.

## Return Value

[true](../../swift/true.md) if the operation was successful, otherwise [false](../../swift/false.md) (for example, if another `NSConnection` object on the same host is already registered under `name`).

## Discussion

This method connects the receive port of the receiving `NSConnection` object with the specified service name. If the operation is successful, other `NSConnection` objects can contact the receiver using the [connectionWithRegisteredName:host:](connectionwithregisteredname_host_.md) and [rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName:host:](rootproxyforconnectionwithregisteredname_host_.md) class methods.

If the receiver was already registered under a name and this method returns [false](../../swift/false.md), the old name remains in effect. If this method is successful, it also unregisters the old name.

To unregister an `NSConnection` object, simply invoke [registerName:](registername_.md) and supply `nil` as the connection name.
