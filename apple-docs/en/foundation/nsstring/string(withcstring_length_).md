# string(withCString:length:)

<sub>Type Method</sub>

Returns a string containing the characters in a given C-string.

> [!warning] Deprecated
> Use `NSString/init(CString:encoding:)-7auq8` instead.

<sub>tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
class func string(withCString bytes: UnsafePointer<CChar>, length: Int) -> Any?
```

## Discussion

`cString` must not be NULL. `cString` should contain characters in the default C-string encoding. This method converts `length` * `sizeof(char)` bytes from `cString` and doesn’t stop short at a `NULL` character.
