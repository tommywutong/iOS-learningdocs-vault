# contentModificationDateKey

<sub>Type Property</sub>

The time at which the resource was most recently modified.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
static let contentModificationDateKey: URLResourceKey
```

## Discussion

This key corresponds to an [NSDate](../nsdate.md) value, or `nil` if the volume doesn’t support modification dates.

The corresponding resource is read-write.
