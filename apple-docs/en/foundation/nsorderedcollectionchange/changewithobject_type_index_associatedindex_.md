# changeWithObject:type:index:associatedIndex:

<sub>Type Method</sub>

Creates an change object that represents inserting or removing an object from an ordered collection at a specific index, matched with an associated location that infers a move within the collection.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```objc
+ (NSOrderedCollectionChange<id> *) changeWithObject:(ObjectType) anObject type:(NSCollectionChangeType) type index:(NSUInteger) index associatedIndex:(NSUInteger) associatedIndex;
```

## Parameters

- `anObject` — An object to be removed or inserted by the change.

- `type` — The type of change

- `index` — The index location within an ordered collection where the change applies.

- `associatedIndex` — The index of the change’s counterpart of the opposite type in the diff.

## Return Value

An object that represents an indexed change to an ordered collection and references the object to be inserted or removed with an associated index that infers a move within the collection.

## Discussion

Pairs of changes with opposite types that refer to each other represent the index location of their counterpart with the [associatedIndex](associatedindex.md) property. Initializing a [NSOrderedCollectionDifference](../nsorderedcollectiondifference.md) with broken associations (or associations that aren’t reflexive) will generate an exception. The following example creates a diff where the object `@”Red”` moves from index `8` to index `3`:

```objc
NSOrderedCollectionDifference *diff = [[NSOrderedCollectionDifference alloc] initWithChanges:@[
    [NSOrderedCollectionChange changeWithObject:@"Red" type:NSCollectionChangeRemove index:8 associatedIndex:3],
    [NSOrderedCollectionChange changeWithObject:@"Red" type:NSCollectionChangeInsert index:3 associatedIndex:8]
]];
```

A move pair can have a different `object` in its removal and insertion changes, which can imply that the change represents moving and changing or replacing an element. Diffs that [controller(_:didChangeContentWith:)](<../../coredata/nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate/controller(__didchangecontentwith_)-5ullb.md>) passes to delegates of [NSFetchedResultsController](../../coredata/nsfetchedresultscontroller.md) communicate that an object changed even when its position in the results is unaffected.

> [!note] Note
> Don’t ignore a move when the indexes of its changes are the same. The calculated difference from `@[@”A”, @”B”, @”C”]` to `@[@”C”, @”B”]` may legitimately produce a diff where the change removes the object at index 0 and the object at index 1 moves to index 1. Ignoring the move produces the incorrect result `@[@”B”, @”C”]`.
