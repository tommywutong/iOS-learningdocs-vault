# name

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

Returns the name of the receiver.

<sub>Mac Catalyst, macOS</sub>

```swift
var name: String? { get set }
```

## Return Value

Returns a string specifying the name of the receiver. May return `nil` if the receiver is not a valid kind of node (see discussion).

## Discussion

This method is applicable only to `NSXMLNode` objects representing elements, attributes, namespaces, processing instructions, and DTD-declaration nodes. If the receiver is not an object of one of these kinds, this method returns `nil`. For example, in the following construction:

```objc
<title>Chapter One</title>
```

The returned name for the element is “title”. If the name is associated with a namespace, the qualified name is returned. For example, if you create an element with local name “foo” and URI “http://bar.com” and the namespace “xmlns:baz=‘http://bar.com’” is applied to this node, when you invoke this method on the node you get “baz:foo”.
