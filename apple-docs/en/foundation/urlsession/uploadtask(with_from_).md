# uploadTask(with:from:)

<sub>Instance Method</sub>

Creates a task that performs an HTTP request for the specified URL request object and uploads the provided data.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS</sub>

```swift
func uploadTask(with request: URLRequest, from bodyData: Data) -> URLSessionUploadTask
```

## Parameters

- `request` — A URL request object that provides the URL, cache policy, request type, and so on. The body stream and body data in this request object are ignored.

- `bodyData` — The body data for the request.

## Return Value

The new session upload task.

## Discussion

An HTTP upload request is any request that contains a request body, such as a `POST` or `PUT` request. Upload tasks require you to create a request object so that you can provide metadata for the upload, like HTTP request headers.

After you create the task, you must start it by calling its [- resume](<../urlsessiontask/resume().md>) method. The task calls methods on the session’s delegate to provide you with the upload’s progress, response metadata, response data, and so on.
