# Audio and music

Play, record, and process audio, and find and play content from Apple Music and someone’s music library.

Whether you’re adding audio touches to your app’s UI, or building your own audio-editing app, Apple has the audio technologies you need. Audio plays an important role in many apps, with specialized audio hardware built in to all Apple devices. The software you use to access that hardware ensures playback is efficient, and helps you work with a wide variety of audio formats.

### Add user interface sounds and haptic feedback

You can enhance your app with audio and haptic feedback. Consider the feedback that the system apps provide: Mail plays a whoosh when you send an email, Camera plays a shutter click when you take a photo, and Photos provides haptic feedback when editing photos. These sensory cues create engaging and tactile experiences.

Apple offers several APIs that support audio playback, including:

- **[System Sound Services](../audiotoolbox/audio-services.md)** — A C-based set of APIs available as part of the [Audio Toolbox](../audiotoolbox.md) framework. Provides interfaces to [play](<../audiotoolbox/audioservicesplaysystemsound(__).md>) short, uncompressed audio files of 30 seconds or less. These APIs don’t provide playback controls, support volume adjustments, or allow simultaneous sound playback, but do offer an efficient, low-latency solution to add audio feedback.
- **[AVAudioPlayer](../avfaudio/avaudioplayer.md)** — Enables you to play compressed and uncompressed audio files of any length. Gives you full control over playback, looping, and volume that makes it an ideal choice when you need greater control than what’s available with system sound services.

Haptic feedback delivers a tactile effect that draws attention and reinforces actions and events. While many system-provided UI components like pickers, switches, and sliders automatically provide haptic feedback, you can also add feedback to custom views and controls in your app:

- The simplest way to support custom [haptic feedback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ApplePencil/playing-haptic-feedback-in-your-app) is to use the support available in your app’s UI framework. For example, provide [sensory feedback](../swiftui/sensoryfeedback.md) in SwiftUI or  [generate feedback](../uikit/uifeedbackgenerator.md) in UIKit, to provide feedback for common interactions like selection events or value changes.
- When you require more advanced control, use [Core Haptics](../corehaptics.md) to deliver customized haptic feedback on supported devices like iPhone and Apple Watch. This framework allows you to deliver nuanced tactile feedback by combining haptic patterns with audio. Using Core Haptics, you can define continuous or transient haptic events with precise control over intensity and sharpness, making it ideal for enhancing interactions in games, music apps, or productivity tools.

### Play music from the Apple Music catalog and user libraries

Add music playback to your app for a rich, engaging experience that feels deeply personal. You might create an app to help people find new music or rediscover their old favorites, a fitness app that plays a motivating soundtrack to power someone’s workout, or a meditation app with a playlist of ambient soundscapes.

Play music from Apple Music’s vast catalog with [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/musickit/), a combination of client frameworks and the [Apple Music API](../applemusicapi.md). Discover and fetch content from Apple Music, including artists, albums, playlists, and more, with features that enable you search the catalog and browse the latest charts. You can also use MusicKit to provide access to personalized features, including a person’s music library, recommendations, and recently played history. MusicKit client frameworks provide the APIs needed to authenticate subscribers and start and control playback on a device. Client frameworks are available for apps on [Apple platforms](../musickit.md), [web applications](https://js-cdn.music.apple.com/musickit/v1/index.html) using JavaScript, and [Android applications](https://developer.apple.com/musickit/android/) using the available SDK.

### Perform basic playback and recording of audio files

You can provide audio feedback in response to user input, play background music for your app or game, or record audio in a journaling or note-taking app.

Two classes in the [AVFAudio](../avfaudio.md) framework provide high-level interfaces for audio playback and recording across Apple platforms. These classes simplify working with audio, which makes them accessible to developers without requiring an understanding how to perform low-level audio processing:

- Use [AVAudioPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioplayer) to play audio files in a variety of formats, including AAC, WAV, and MP3. It supports features that enable you to start and stop playback, adjust the volume level and playback rate, enable seamless looping, and more. It also provides features that you can use to respond to events like playback completion or decoding errors. Use it for a variety of audio playback tasks, including background music, user interface sound effects, and synchronizing multiple players.
- Use [AVAudioRecorder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioplayer) to add basic microphone capture and recording capabilities to your app. It provides the interface to configure the recording settings, such as sample rate, number of channels, and audio format, and provides real-time metering of the input signal. It offers you a robust feature set to create apps that capture voice memos, audio notes, and more.

Together, these classes provide a straightforward way to add rich audio features into your app.

### Perform advanced playback, recording, and processing

When your needs grow beyond simple playback and recording of local audio files, Apple provides APIs that support advanced cases. For example, you can use these APIs to play streaming audio, enable musicians to mix custom backing tracks for practice or performance, or support a singer in a karaoke app by adding effects like reverb or delay.

Use the [AVFAudio](../avfaudio.md) framework’s [AVAudioEngine](../avfaudio/avaudioengine.md) API to perform real-time audio processing and mixing. It provides a node-based design that enables you to connect audio sources, effects, and outputs, making it ideal for apps that need to create advanced audio pipelines for real-time audio processing. For example, a game could use `AVAudioEngine` to blend background music, sound effects, and spatial audio cues, or a podcasting app could apply live noise cancellation or equalization.
