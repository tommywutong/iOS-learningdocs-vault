# ScreenCaptureKit updates

## Overview

Browse notable changes in [ScreenCaptureKit](../screencapturekit.md).

## June 2024

### AppKit

- Share an app window with a remote viewer on demand with `requestSharingOfWindow(_ window: NSWindow, completionHandler: @escaping ((any Error)?)`. This method enables an app to share a window in response to a specific action, such as when a person clicks play in a document window, and streamlines a previously multistep window-sharing process.
- Share a preview of a window with a remote viewer on demand with `requestSharingOfWindow(usingPreview image: NSImage, title: String, completionHandler: @escaping ((any Error)?)`, which causes the framework to call a delegate method to provide the window if there’s a valid sharing session and a person confirms the offer to share.

### SwiftUI

- Create new, sharable windows using the async function `openWindow(id: String, sharingBehavior: SharingBehavior)`. This method gives presenting apps a way to share just the window they want recipients to see, even if that window takes over the entire screen and doesn’t allow access to the window picker, streamlining a previously multistep window-sharing process.

### ScreenCaptureKit

- Capture screenshots across multiple displays.
- Capture HDR content by adopting the `captureDynamicRange` property in `SCStreamConfiguration`, which allows clients to choose between ` SCCaptureModeSDR`, `SCCaptureModeHDRLocalDisplay`, and `SCCaptureModeHDRCanonicalDisplay` modes. Or use `SCStreamConfigurationPreset` to simplify the selection of properties needed for capture HDR.
- Capture microphone audio by streaming output with the `SCStreamOutputTypeMicrophone` type to a sample handler queue that the framework processes and returns audio samples in buffers to the client via the stream’s `didOutputSampleBuffer` delegate method.
- Record a stream’s screen, audio, and microphone output to a file using the `outputURL` property of `SCRecordingOutput`, which enables you to specify where the framework saves a recording file. Properties available in `SCRecordingOutputConfiguration` allow you to select the characteristics of the recording by choosing the file and codec types for the recording. The `SCRecordingOutputConfiguration` class methods enable you to enumerate the available codecs and file types ScreenCaptureKit supports.
- Start and stop recordings with two new methods on `SCStream` using `addRecordingOutput` and `removeRecordingOutput`.
- Respond to events occur during the process of recording to a file with `SCRecordingOutputDelegate`.

## June 2023

- Use the new sharing picker: [SCContentSharingPicker](../screencapturekit/sccontentsharingpicker.md).
- Access new properties of [AVCaptureDevice](../avfoundation/avcapturedevice.md) for status on effects relevant to screen capture.
- Take screenshots with [SCStream](../screencapturekit/scstream.md).
- Deprecated `CGStream`. Use [SCStreamConfiguration](../screencapturekit/scstreamconfiguration.md) instead.
