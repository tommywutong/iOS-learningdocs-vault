# Hypervisor updates

Learn about important changes to Hypervisor.

## Overview

Browse notable changes in [Hypervisor](../hypervisor.md).

## June 2025

- Support configuration of the intermediate physical address (IPA) memory granularity of a virtual machine (VM). This capability enables more efficient use of memory and allows for granularity sizes down to 4 KB, which is useful for certain specialized device drivers.

## June 2024

- Build your own VM solutions with added support for nested virtualization in Apple silicon chips, and enable a Hypervisor to run inside another VM. Nested virtualization capabilities on a Mac with Apple silicon use a new exception level (EL), EL2, which the framework enables though several new methods, including [hv_vm_config_set_el2_enabled(_:_:)](<../hypervisor/hv_vm_config_set_el2_enabled(____).md>), and a number of enumeration constants that describe ARM system registers.
- Add support for virtualized ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) devices and provide an efficient mechanism to manage interrupt delivery to a virtual machine. Providing a GIC device reduces the custom code you need to write to emulate an interrupt controller.
- Add support for GIC hypervisor control system registers that GIC devices provide for nested virtualization support. Support for these registers allows hypervisors running in a virtual machine to inject interrupts to their guests.
