## Overview

Browse notable changes in [MetricKit](../metrickit.md).

## June 2026

### Metric manager

- Adopt [MetricManager](../metrickit/metricmanager.md) to receive metric and diagnostic reports through asynchronous sequences. `MetricManager` replaces [MXMetricManager](../metrickit/mxmetricmanager.md) and its subscriber protocol. For an overview of the MetricKit reporting model, see [Monitoring app performance with MetricKit](../metrickit/monitoring-app-performance-with-metrickit.md).
- Receive daily aggregated performance data through [MetricReport](../metrickit/metricreport.md), which conforms to `Codable` and `Sendable` for straightforward serialization and safe cross-actor use.
- Receive event-based diagnostic data through [DiagnosticReport](../metrickit/diagnosticreport.md). Handle each metric type using [MetricResult](../metrickit/metricresult.md). For information on working with metric values and diagnostic data in MetricKit reports, see [Analyzing app performance with MetricKit](../metrickit/analyzing-app-performance-with-metrickit.md).

### State-contextualized metrics

- Use the [StateReporting](../statereporting.md) framework with MetricKit to segment performance data by app-defined states in addition to intervals. For information on integrating the StateReporting framework with MetricKit, see [Getting started with StateReporting](../statereporting/getting-started-with-statereporting.md).
