# Background Assets

<sub>Framework</sub>

Improve or eliminate the time people wait while your app downloads assets.

## Overview

Let the system manage your asset downloads on people’s devices for you according to your preferences, and optionally, host your assets on Apple servers. For example, a game might specify that the system downloads tutorial assets before first launch and other assets on demand — such as level packs, 3D character models, and textures — as a player progresses during gameplay. The default implementation of Managed Background Assets handles downloads, updates, compression, and more for you. If you choose Apple-Hosted Background Assets, you upload your assets to App Store Connect and maintain them there, similar to app builds.

Each progress indicator displays an icon that represents that specific content type such as a music note for audio.</sub>

> [!note] visionOS availability
> For compatible iPad and iPhone apps, Background Assets is available in visionOS 1.0 and later. For apps built for visionOS, Background Assets is available in visionOS 2.4 and later.

To use these features:

1. Group your assets into asset packs containing manifest files that specify a download policy and other details. You can specify that the system downloads essential asset packs before launch, prefetches others without blocking launch, and downloads some only on demand when you need them. For more information, see [Creating managed asset packs](backgroundassets/creating-managed-asset-packs.md).
2. Add a managed Background Download extension to your project and configure your project accordingly. Optionally, customize your downloader extension and add code to your app that downloads on-demand assets when needed. For more information, see [Downloading Apple-hosted asset packs](backgroundassets/downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs.md).
3. For either Apple-hosted or self-hosted asset packs, before you distribute your app, test your code using a local mock server included in your Xcode install. For more information, see [Testing asset packs locally](backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-locally.md).
4. For Apple-hosted assets, upload your asset packs to App Store Connect before you distribute your app through TestFlight or the App Store. For more information, see the [Overview of Apple-hosted asset packs](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-asset-packs/overview-of-apple-hosted-asset-packs) in App Store Connect Help.

Alternatively, you can manage and host asset downloads yourself using the low-level Background Assets APIs. For more information, see [Configuring an unmanaged Background Assets project](backgroundassets/configuring-an-unmanaged-background-assets-project.md) and [Downloading essential assets in the background](backgroundassets/downloading-essential-assets-in-the-background.md).

> [!important] Important
> Use the Background Assets framework only to download additional assets for your app; don’t use it for any other purposes. For example, don’t collect or transmit data to identify a user or device or to perform advertising or advertising measurement.
