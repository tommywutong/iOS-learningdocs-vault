# activeColorSpace

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

The currently active color space for capture.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS</sub>

```swift
var activeColorSpace: AVCaptureColorSpace { get set }
```

## Discussion

All devices and formats support capture in the sRGB color space. Some devices and formats can also capture in the P3 color space, which includes a much wider gamut of colors than the sRGB color space. By default, a capture session automatically enables wide-gamut capture for supported devices and capture workflows—for details, see the [automaticallyConfiguresCaptureDeviceForWideColor](../avcapturesession/automaticallyconfigurescapturedeviceforwidecolor.md) of your capture session. To instead set the color space manually, disable that [AVCaptureSession](../avcapturesession.md) property before setting the active color space.

For best results, choose a color space before calling [- startRunning](<../avcapturesession/startrunning().md>) on your capture session. Changing this property while a capture session is running requires a disruptive reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline—movie captures in progress ends immediately, unfulfilled photo requests abort, and video preview temporarily freeze.

Before changing this property, you must call the [- lockForConfiguration:](<lockforconfiguration().md>) method to obtain exclusive access to the capture device. Attempting to change this property without locking the device raises an exception ([genericException](../../foundation/nsexceptionname/genericexception.md)).
