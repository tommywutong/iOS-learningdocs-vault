# hardwareCost

<sub>Instance Property</sub>

A value that indicates the percentage of the session’s available hardware budget in use.

<sub>iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, tvOS</sub>

```swift
var hardwareCost: Float { get }
```

## Discussion

This property provides a floating-point value from `0.0` to `1.0` that indicates the percentage of a capture session’s hardware that it currently uses. When the value is greater than `1.0`, the capture session can’t run in its current configuration due to hardware constraints. Attempting to start the session while it’s in this state results in a runtime error.

Factors that contribute to the hardware cost include:

- The active formats of the source devices. Some formats use the full sensor (4:3) and others a crop (16:9). Cropped formats require lower hardware bandwidth, and therefore lower the cost.
- The maximum frame rate of the source devices’ active formats. The hardware cost increases when using high frame rates.
- Whether the source devices uses binned formats. Binned formats require substantially less hardware bandwidth, and therefore result in a lower cost.
- The number of sources configured to deliver streaming disparity and depth using [AVCaptureDepthDataOutput](../avcapturedepthdataoutput.md). The higher the number of cameras configured to produce depth, the higher the cost.

To reduce the hardware cost, consider picking a sensor-cropped or binned [activeFormat](../avcapturedevice/activeformat.md). You may also use a device input’s [videoMinFrameDurationOverride](../avcapturedeviceinput/videominframedurationoverride.md) property to artificially limit the maximum frame rate of a source device to a lower value. By doing so, you only pay the hardware cost for the maximum frame rate you intend to use.

> [!note] Note
> [AVCaptureSession](../avcapturesession.md) only computes a nonzero hardware cost when you add multiple [AVCaptureVideoDataOutput](../avcapturevideodataoutput.md) objects to the session, or an [AVCaptureMovieFileOutput](../avcapturemoviefileoutput.md) instance and one or more instances of [AVCaptureVideoDataOutput](../avcapturevideodataoutput.md).
