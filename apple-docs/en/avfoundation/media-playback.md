# Media playback

<sub>API Collection</sub>

Manage the playback of media assets and interstitial content, independent of how you present that content in your interface.

## Overview

You use a player to manage the playback and timing of a media asset, for example starting and stopping playback, and seeking to a particular time. A player manages the playback of a single media asset at a time. The framework also provides a queue player that queues media assets to play sequentially.

> [!note] Note
> When you use AVFoundation, Apple may collect metrics to help improve the framework.

You create an instance of [AVPlayerItem](avplayeritem.md) to play a media asset. A player item manages the timing and presentation state of an asset played by the player. A player item also contains player item tracks that correspond to the tracks in the asset. You direct the output of a player to a specialized Core Animation layer, a player layer, or a synchronized layer.

> [!important] Important
> You must call the [VTRegisterProfessionalVideoWorkflowVideoDecoders()](<../videotoolbox/vtregisterprofessionalvideoworkflowvideodecoders().md>) function if your app requires Afterburner accelerated playback and decoding of ProRes and ProRes RAW video files.
