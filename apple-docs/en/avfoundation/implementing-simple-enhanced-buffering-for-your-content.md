# Implementing simple enhanced buffering for your content

<sub>Article</sub>

Configure your app for simple enhanced buffering to stream content faster to AirPlay-enabled devices and supported CarPlay vehicles.

## Overview

The [AVPlayer](avplayer.md) and [AVQueuePlayer](avqueueplayer.md) classes provide the simplest way to enhance buffering for your content with AirPlay 2.

To implement simple enhanced buffering, complete the following steps.

1. Create a player.

```swift
let player = AVQueuePlayer()
```

1. Identify a URL that points to local or cloud content that you want to play.
2. Create an [AVAsset](avasset.md) instance with a URL, and then create an [AVPlayerItem](avplayeritem.md) instance with that asset.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "http://www.examplecontenturl.com")!
let asset = AVAsset(url: url)
let item = AVPlayerItem(asset: asset)
```

1. Give the player item to the player.

```swift
player.insert(item, after: nil)
```

1. Start playback.

```swift
player.play()
```
