## Discussion

This notification name has been deprecated. Use either AVFragmentedMovieTrackTimeRangeDidChangeNotification or AVFragmentedMovieTrackSegmentsDidChangeNotification instead; in either case, you can assume that timing changes to fragmented tracks result in changes to the total length of the sample data used by the track.

- [AVFragmentedMovieContainsMovieFragmentsDidChangeNotification](avfragmentedmoviecontainsmoviefragmentsdidchangenotification.md) — Posted after the value of @“containsMovieFragments” has already been loaded and the AVFragmentedMovie is added to an AVFragmentedMovieMinder, either when 1) movie fragments are detected in the movie file on disk after it had previously contained none or when 2) no movie fragments are detected in the movie file on disk after it had previously contained one or more.
- [AVFragmentedMovieDurationDidChangeNotification](avfragmentedmoviedurationdidchangenotification.md) — Posted when the duration of an AVFragmentedMovie changes while it’s being minded by an AVFragmentedMovieMinder, but only for changes that occur after the status of the value of @“duration” has reached AVKeyValueStatusLoaded.
